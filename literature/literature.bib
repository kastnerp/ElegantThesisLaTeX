abstract = {Evaluating the efficiency of a ventilation system in providing a healthy indoor environment to building occupants requires the knowledge of the airflow inside the room prior to the calculation of the pollutant dispersal from their sources. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling is probably the most suitable method to achieve this as it provides detailed information about the airflow pattern but is still time-consuming although processor speed has tremendously increased during the past years. Consequently, parametric studies aimed at characterizing the influence of parameters such as the location of the air inlets and outlets or furniture on the air velocity, temperature and concentration distributions within the building are seldom achieved. Zonal, Coarse-grid CFD and Fast Fluid Dynamics (FFD) are intermediate models between CFD and single air node models; they can predict the airflow pattern in a room or group of rooms with less computational efforts but with a lower accuracy than CFD models. The present study aims at improving the zonal prediction for the case of forced convection in indoor spaces. Results show that the proposed alterations of zonal modeling greatly improve the prediction and that this model requires less computational efforts and returns more accurate results than Coarse-grid CFD and FFD. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in the building sector is a major concern, especially in tropical climates where high temperatures and humidity force occupants to use electro-mechanical ventilation. Passive design strategies, in particular the application of natural ventilation, are one of the main techniques to moderate temperatures in buildings. Furthermore, many studies have shown reduced operating costs, better thermal comfort and indoor air quality, to be some of the advantages of the application of natural ventilation in buildings. Although existing studies support the efficiency of natural ventilation, the efficiency and practicability of architectural elements to maximise ventilation in buildings remains problematic. This study reviews studies on natural ventilation with other passive design strategies in tropical climates in order to support the argument for the application of natural ventilation in tropical climates. Through a review of studies on the operation of natural ventilation in buildings, it also identifies the most effective architectural elements and techniques in building fa??ades and ventilation openings. The results indicate that ventilation shafts, window-to-wall ratio and building orientation should be applied in future construction. This study also identifies some further specific elements that are worth further investigation, including the shape of louvered windows, different forms of apertures and vernacular elements.},

abstract = {This study evaluates two common methods to represent landslide polygons as frequencies for use within GIS analysis. These methods are used to extract information from factor maps, such as a single value for slope angle for the landslide polygon, which is then used in hazard assessment. Understanding the errors associated with generating points to represent landslide polygons should be clearly understood to evaluate the effectiveness of these points. In this paper, the effectiveness of two representation techniques in gathering slope angle information is examined. The first technique evaluated is based on the centroid (a point feature) of each landslide polygon. The value of the landslide factor class beneath the centroid point, e.g. the slope value at that point, selects the landslide factor class. The second method is an area based technique which depends on the area covered by different landslide factor classes, e.g. the most common slope for the polygon. Here, the landslide factor class that occupies most of the landslide polygon is selected as the attribute for each landslide polygon. As demonstrated in this paper, the results favour the area based technique. While this paper explores this technique for slope information, the finding is applicable to other landslide causal factors, such as elevation and rock type.},

In this study, the authors measured the spatial distribution of the pressure drag acting on the walls of rectangular block arrays in a wind tunnel. The arrays were arranged with staggered, square, and diamond layouts under different conditions of roughness and packing density. The total drag and wind profiles of the arrays were preliminarily measured. On the basis of experimental results, the contribution of pressure drag to the total surface drag on staggered cube arrays was estimated at greater than 95{\%}. In addition, the bulk pressure coefficients C p for the arrays defined by mean velocity at a height of H, 2H and 20H were derived (H refers to the height of a block), and the clear relation between C p and the block packing densities were shown for rough estimation of wind-induced ventilation in urban buildings. In addition, the authors present a simple mathematical expression to explain the relationship. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The turbulent nature of wind significantly complicates the airflow-exchange process at single openings that function as both inlets and outlets simultaneously. For such flow problems, describing the ventilation rate using a constant value is insufficient if the fluctuating intensity is too large. This paper uses a large eddy simulation (LES) model combined with the tracer gas concentration decay method to investigate fluctuating ventilation characteristics through a single opening under various approaching wind directions. The numerical method is validated against a field measurement of single-sided ventilation rates. Results show that wind direction (which characterizes the external airflow pattern) greatly influences the airflow exchange at a single opening. The ventilation rate is relatively steady for a windward opening and shows more unsteadiness for a lateral and a leeward opening. The airflow-exchange process is mainly driven by the mean flow at the windward opening and is dominated by the turbulent flow at the lateral opening. The findings from this study imply that the turbulence-induced component of single-sided ventilation rates should always be considered, especially for non-windward openings. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on both the RANS and LES turbulence models, the most commonly used predictive methods, namely the integration and tracer gas decay methods, are examined. A range of wind directions are considered, since the characteristics of both building aerodynamics and ventilation mechanics are distinctive under different wind directions. The performance of numerical model is thoroughly evaluated, including validation against field measurements. Specific attention is paid to sensitivity analyses of the near-wall mesh density.

abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the performance of different methods in determining single-sided ventilation rates in multistory buildings. The study is motivated by the fact that the methods established from very simple physical models, such as a single-room building, have been applied directly to multistory buildings. On-site measurement in a multistory building was conducted to verify the applicability of existing empirical models. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was performed to (a) examine the integration method and the tracer gas decay method and (b) investigate the ventilation characteristics of a multistory building and how these differ from the ventilation characteristics of a single-room building. The empirical models are not applicable to multistory buildings as they cannot account for the difference in ventilation rate between different rooms in the same building. This study finds that the CFD method is particularly suitable for the determination of ventilation rates in multistory buildings despite the fact that the methods reproduced by CFD simulation are compromised by the accuracy of the velocity and turbulence fields generated by the selected numerical model. Finally, a parametric study shows that an increase in the incident k profile leads to a significant decrease in ventilation rate to the leeward rooms. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Single-sided ventilation rate is difficult to accurately predict because it has a complex relationship with many factors, including the direction of the approaching wind and building envelope features. In addition, the incursion of outdoor pollutants into the interior through a ventilation opening has been recognized as a serious threat to indoor air quality (IAQ). This article presents on-site measurements of the ventilation performance and IAQ in four high-rise residential rooms in Hong Kong. Key parameters including the air changes per hour, respirable suspended particulate matters (PM: PM10 and PM2.5), and total volatile organic compounds were continuously recorded over a specified period. A comparison of cases with floor-extended and window-like openings is made. The results indicate that single-sided ventilation performs well regardless of the orientation of the apartment room and the configuration of the opening. Previous empirical models based on single-room buildings are not reliable in determining the ventilation rate of high-rise buildings. The measurements reported here also identify an important route for the incursion of outdoor pollutants, namely the downward re-entry of aerosol particles from an upper unit to a lower unit in the same building. A combination of gravitational and wind effects means this downward transport route significantly increases the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in the lower room.},

abstract = {Compared with the buoyancy-dominated upward spread, the interunit dispersion of pollutants in wind-dominated conditions is expected to be more complex and multiple. The aim of this study is to investigate the wind-induced airflow and interunit pollutant dispersion in typical multistory residential buildings using computational fluid dynamics. The mathematical model used is the nonstandard k- model incorporated with a two-layer near-wall modification, which is validated against experiments of previous investigators. Using tracer gas technique, the reentry of exhaust air from each distinct unit to other units on the same building, under different practical conditions, is quantified, and then, the possible dispersion routes are revealed. The units on the floor immediately below the source on the windward side, and vertically above it on the leeward side, where the reentry ratios are up to 4.8{\%} and 14.9{\%}, respectively, should be included on the high-infection list. It is also found that the presence of balconies results in a more turbulent near-wall flow field, which in turn significantly changes the reentry characteristics. Comparison of the dispersion characteristics of the slab-like building and the more complicated building in cross ({\#}) floorplan concludes that distinctive infectious control measures should be implemented in these two types of buildings.

This investigation studied single-sided natural ventilation by using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, together with analytical and empirical models. The CFD model was applied to determine the effects of buoyancy, wind, or their combination on ventilation rates and indoor conditions. For buoyancy-driven flow, the CFD results are within a 10{\%} difference from the semi-analytical results. For combined wind- and buoyancy-driven flow, CFD may have underpredicted the empirical model results by approximately 25{\%}.

abstract = {An approach for dealing with turbulent flows over a surface-mounted cube using the wall y+ as guidance in selecting the appropriate grid configuration and corresponding turbulence models are investigated using Fluent. The study is divided into two parts - Part I and Part II, dealing with low and high Reynolds numbers, respectively. In Part I presented here, a Reynolds number of 1,870 based on cube height and bulk velocity is investigated and the computation results are compared with data from Meinders et al. (1999) on  the experimental study of local convective heat transfer from a wall-mounted cube in turbulent channel flow.? The standard k-$\epsilon$, standard k-$\omega$, Reynolds Stress Model (RSM), Spalart-Allmaras (SA) and renormalization group (RNG) k-$\epsilon$ turbulence models are used to solve the closure problem. Their behaviours together with the accompanying near-wall treatments are investigated for wall y+ 1 covering the viscous sublayer and y+ 7 in the buffer region. Notably, adopting a wall y+ in the log-law region, where y+ {\textgreater}30, would result in a poor mesh resolution due to the low Reynolds number of the main flow but is taken into consideration in the high Reynolds number flow case (Part 2   Ariff et al., 2009). Overall, SA gave better agreement with experimental data and predicted the re-attachment length similar to DNS results as reported by Alexandar et al. (2006).},

abstract = {This paper investigates the potential of the vaulted roofs for improving wind-induced natural ventilation, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) three-dimensional modelling. This has been carried out in a parametric study considering different climatic and geometrical parameters. Using Fluent 5.5 program, natural ventilation performance has been modelled and assessed according to the value of airflow rate, and the quality of internal airflow distribution. It has been concluded that utilisation of vaulted roofs for natural ventilation increases inflow rate of the building, and re-distribute internal airflow currents by attracting some of the air to leave through roof openings instead of walls openings. This has improved ventilation conditions in the upstream and central zones of the building, but not in the downstream zone. Natural ventilation performance of two equivalent domed and vaulted roofs has also been compared. Results showed that there are many similarities between domed and vaulted roofs in terms of their natural ventilation performance. The advantage of any roof shape in air suction is highly dependant on wind direction. ?? 2008.},

The CFD software used is Fluent 5.5. Comparison between the predicted and simulated airflow rate is suggested as a validation method of the implemented CFD code, while the common practice is to compare CFD outputs to wind tunnel or full-scale measurements. This could be useful for studies that have no access to laboratory or full-scale testing facilities. Results obtained from testing a number of cases have been compared and analysed, considering normal and oblique wind directions. The comparison held between mathematical and CFD results generally showed a good agreement, which seems to justify the use of CFD code for predicting natural ventilation in buildings. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An approach to the analysis of climate suitability is presented and applied to a number of North American climates. The climate suitability method presented offers an approach to predesign analysis for ventilative cooling that is climate specific and accounts for the expected level of internal and solar gains for a building. The climate suitability analysis also yields estimates of ventilation rates that are likely to be needed to achieve either a direct ventilative or night cooling design strategy.},

abstract = {This paper explores the pedestrian-level wind environment around two buildings of unequal heights for the effects of ratio of height of upwind building to that of downwind building, referred to as buildings height ratio, spacing distance between the buildings, and direction of ambient wind, on the outdoor air ventilation. The objective is to propose appropriate spacing distances for various configurations of this type of buildings layout in a suburban area of Kuala Lumpur, which would enable harnessing the full ventilation potential of the local wind conditions. A three-dimensional numerical technique employing computational fluid dynamics simulation of continuity and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations was used to study the turbulent flow field around the full-scale sizes of the buildings. Results indicate the influence of spacing distance between buildings, relative heights of the buildings and direction of ambient wind on outdoor ventilation. Results also show that 3-D turbulent flow processes such as lateral and secondary flows play significant roles in defining the wind flow pattern and ventilation availability. The perpendicular wind direction presents remarkable adverse effects compared to the inclined direction, while a higher upwind building height which would ordinarily be expected to proportionally obstruct wind flow could be of advantage, at low values of building height ratios, in enhancing outdoor ventilation. The findings established the need to give consideration to climatic factors such as wind flow and direction in planning urban cities, as it affects buildings to be situated in close proximity, especially when there is height difference.},

The CFD model is then applied to investigate the physical mechanism of the air movement.

It also minimizes the risk of the environmental pollution and the global warming. A one story, full scale building was considered to carry out a comparative study of three different cases of wind-driven natural (WDN) cross ventilation with the help of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In each case, the location of window was changed in lateral direction to predict the probable position for optimum ventilation performance and the angle of wind was varied to check the sensitivity of the wind direction on the flow field. After validating the current methodology through two satisfactory comparisons with the experimental investigations, the governing equations subjected to the corresponding boundary conditions were solved using commercial software and then the results were analyzed. A better location for the windows in each case was proposed. The ventilation purpose was served quite well even if the wind angle was changed in a moderate range from the original design. Furthermore, the velocity components, ventilation rate, surface pressure, ventilation time, and so forth in each case were investigated and compared extensively with those in other cases.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results from the experimental and numerical study of a room with mixing ventilation, focused on the local mean age of air (LMA). The measurements were performed using the tracer gas concentration decay method. The numerical predictions were obtained from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) module of the latest version of the ESP-r software. In order to address the requirement for a proper choice of the number of control volumes in CFD, the analysis is made by comparing the results from two consequently finer numerical grids. Some guidelines for practising engineers are given concerning the number of numerical grid points and their distribution, reasonable for buildings energy simulations. The guidelines are based on common CFD rules supported by examples from the presented computations. Both the fine and the coarse grid computations gave results, which were very close to the measurements. An important issue of the present study is that the coarse grid computations are reasonably close to the measured values, which allows the computation of LMA to be made on relatively coarse numerical grids - sometimes (as in the present study) as low as approximately 1000 grid points.},

The ACS is based on the analysis of 21,000 sets of raw data compiled from field studies in 160 buildings, both airconditioned and naturally ventilated, located on four continents in varied climatic zones. This paper summarizes this earlier research, presents some of its findings for naturally ventilated buildings, and discusses the process of getting the ACS incorporated into Std. 55. We suggest ways the ACS could be used for the design, operation, or evaluation of buildings, and for research applications. We also use GIS mapping technology to examine the energy-savings potential of the ACS on a regional scale. Finally, we discuss related new directions for researchers and practitioners involved in the design of buildings and their environmental control systems.},

abstract = {The construction of a building inevitably changes the microclimate in its vicinity. In particular near high-rise buildings, high wind velocities are often introduced at pedestrian level that can be experienced as uncomfortable or even dangerous. Therefore, the design of a building should not only focus on the building envelope and on providing good indoor environment, but should also include the effect of the design on the outdoor environment. The outdoor environment of a building, in particular related to wind, has received relatively little attention in the Building Physics community. The present paper addresses Building Physicists and focuses on the outdoor wind environment for pedestrians. First, a literature review on pedestrian wind studies is provided. The relation between wind effects, wind comfort, wind danger and wind climate is outlined. A brief review on wind tunnel and numerical modeling of building aerodynamics and pedestrian wind is given. The typical wind flow pattern around buildings and the related wind environment at pedestrian level are discussed. Second, these problems are illustrated by means of four practical examples, where the unfavorable pedestrian wind environment has been, is or should be a matter of serious concern for the building designers and the building owner.},

abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is increasingly used to study a wide variety of complex Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM) processes, such as water flow and turbulent mixing of contaminants in rivers and estuaries and wind flow and air pollution dispersion in urban areas. However, the accuracy and reliability of CFD modeling and the correct use of CFD results can easily be compromised. In 2006, Jakeman et al. set out ten iterative steps of good disciplined model practice to develop purposeful, credible models from data and a priori knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision (Jakeman et al., 2006). This paper discusses the application of the ten-steps approach to CFD for EFM in three parts. In the first part, the existing best practice guidelines for CFD applications in this area are reviewed and positioned in the ten-steps framework. The second and third part present a retrospective analysis of two case studies in the light of the ten-steps approach: (1) contaminant dispersion due to transverse turbulent mixing in a shallow water flow and (2) coupled urban wind flow and indoor natural ventilation of the Amsterdam ArenA football stadium. It is shown that the existing best practice guidelines for CFD mainly focus on the last steps in the ten-steps framework. The reasons for this focus are outlined and the value of the additional - preceding - steps is discussed. The retrospective analysis of the case studies indicates that the ten-steps approach is very well applicable to CFD for EFM and that it provides a comprehensive framework that encompasses and extends the existing best practice guidelines. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Wind comfort and wind safety for pedestrians are important requirements in urban areas. Many city authorities request studies of pedestrian wind comfort and wind safety for new buildings and new urban areas. These studies involve combining statistical meteorological data, aerodynamic information and criteria for wind comfort and wind safety. Detailed aerodynamic information can be obtained using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which offers considerable advantages compared to wind tunnel testing. However, the accuracy and reliability of CFD simulations can easily be compromised. For this reason, several sets of best practice guidelines have been developed in the past decades. Based on these guidelines, this paper presents a general simulation and decision framework for the evaluation of pedestrian wind comfort and wind safety in urban areas with CFD. As a case study, pedestrian wind comfort and safety at the campus of Eindhoven University of Technology are analysed. The turbulent wind flow pattern over the campus terrain is obtained by solving the 3D steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the realisable k- ?? model on an extensive high-resolution grid based on grid-convergence analysis. The simulation results are compared with long-term and short-term on-site wind speed measurements. Wind comfort and wind safety are assessed and potential design improvements are evaluated. The framework and the case study are intended to support and guide future studies of wind comfort and wind safety with CFD and, this way, to contribute to improved wind environmental quality in urban areas. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Information on pedestrian-level wind (PLW) speed for wind comfort assessment can be obtained by wind-tunnel measurements or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Wind-tunnel measurements for PLW are routinely performed with low-cost techniques such as hot-wire or hot-film anemometers, Irwin probes or sand erosion, while Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV) are less often used because they are more expensive. CFD simulations are routinely performed by the relatively low-cost steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach. Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is less often used because of its larger complexity and cost. This paper reviews wind-tunnel and CFD techniques to determine PLW speeds expressed generally in terms of amplification factors defined as the ratio of local mean wind speed to mean wind speed at the same position without buildings present. Some comparative studies systematically indicate that the low-cost wind-tunnel techniques and steady RANS simulations can provide accurate results ({\~{}}10{\%}) at high amplification factors ({\textgreater}1) while their accuracy can deteriorate at lower amplification factors ({\textless}1). This does not necessarily compromise the accuracy of PLW comfort assessment, because the higher amplification factors provide the largest contribution to the discomfort exceedance probability in the comfort criterion. Although LDA, PIV and LES are inherently more accurate techniques, this paper supports the continued use of faster and less expensive techniques for PLW studies. Extrapolating a previous saying, we argue that pedestrian-level wind comfort is one of the few topics in wind engineering where nature is kind to us concerning turbulent flows.},

abstract = {Accurate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow are essential for a wide variety of atmospheric studies including pollutant dispersion and deposition. The accuracy of such simulations can be seriously compromised when wall-function roughness modifications based on experimental data for sand-grain roughened pipes and channels are applied at the bottom of the computational domain. This type of roughness modification is currently present in many CFD codes including Fluent 6.2 and Ansys CFX 10.0, previously called CFX-5. The problems typically manifest themselves as unintended streamwise gradients in the vertical mean wind speed and turbulence profiles as they travel through the computational domain. These gradients can be held responsible-at least partly-for the discrepancies that are sometimes found between seemingly identical CFD simulations performed with different CFD codes and between CFD simulations and measurements. This paper discusses the problem by focusing on the simulation of a neutrally stratified, fully developed, horizontally homogeneous ABL over uniformly rough, flat terrain. The problem and its negative consequences are discussed and suggestions to improve the CFD simulations are made. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The definition of a climate classifications for building design can be an important decision making tool towards climate-responsive and energy-efficient architecture. This paper represents the groundwork for developing bioclimatic zones for building design in Nepal. Based on climatic maps areas of similar climatic conditions were identified. Climate data of various locations within these zone were collected and analysed. A bioclimatic approach was adopted using the psychrometric chart in order to identify passive design strategies for each locations. Finally, an overview of appropriated design strategies for summer and winter for each zones is developed.},

The methods employed allow the prediction of greenhouse air exchange rates as well as the characterization of its components: a steady effect resulting from the combination of both mean wind-related and stack effects and a turbulent effect linked to wind speed fluctuations. Local estimations of total, mean and turbulent flows are provided: a wind parallel to the greenhouse axis produces an inflow at the leeward half and an outflow at the windward half. The mean flow of sensible heat is estimated between 55{\%} and 80{\%} of the total flux so that the turbulent flow does not exceed 45{\%} of the total. Local estimations of total, mean and turbulent flows are compared with air exchange rate measurements using the decay rate method and a good agreement between both approaches is demonstrated.},

The present paper investigates the wind-forced natural ventilation rates of an office as observed with tracer decay, according to ISO 16000-8:2007 Standard, both with an experimental and numerical procedure; experimental data were used to validate the numerical method. Moreover the only infiltration rate case was analyzed. Natural ventilation was created by opening the window and the door of the office. A simulation model of the room was carried out by using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent. The experimental set up of the procedure was developed by a portable gas chromatograph. In both the numerical and experimental approach the mean age of air linking to ventilation efficiency was calculated. The defined experimental procedure can be applied to different situations, in order to evaluate the efficiency of both natural and forced ventilation existing systems. When the ventilation is due to the opening of the window and the door, the simulation results are in a good agreement with the experimental ones, therefore the model could be applied to different situations, in order to reduce costs and time in the evaluation of indoor air quality. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {When a wind flow approaches a building, a recirculation zone is created on the leeward side of the building. This turbulent zone behind the building increases the air mixing at the leeward openings between entering and leaving air. As a consequence the effective temperature difference is reduced at the opening, counteracting the stack effect. Therefore, the air change rate is lower than that in absence of wind. Some empirical correlations have been set up to assess the airflow rate due to the combination of stack and wind effects. However these correlations do not take into account the reduction of airflow rate in leeward conditions. This paper aims to improve the existing correlations and in particular to confront the issue related to leeward openings. The study is based on CFD simulations and full scale experiments. A comparison of Warren's correlation with CFD and experimental results shows that this correlation captures well the stack and wind effects in windward conditions but shows poor results in leeward conditions. Thus, a new correlation has been developed by using CFD simulations in leeward conditions. The new correlation is then compared with the full-scale experiments and concords well. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Natural ventilation can contribute to the reduction of the air conditioning demand and to the improvement of thermal comfort in buildings. In this paper, the flow field and the air change rate generated by a simple configuration of natural ventilation, namely single-sided ventilation, are examined experimentally. The experiments are realized in a full scale building exposed to outdoor conditions, using several measurement techniques. The main features of the flow generated by stack and wind effect are examined for different outdoor conditions (temperature difference, wind speed and direction). Finally, measured air change rates are compared to those calculated by existing correlations in order to analyze their applicability to the experimental configuration. Results show that the wind generates turbulence diffusion at the opening, counteracting the stack effect. Moreover, in the case of windward opening, there is an additional effect, namely the effect of mixing layer, which tends to increase the airflow rate. Existing correlations give reasonably good results in the case of windward opening, while in the case of leeward opening they overestimate the airflow rate. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Single-sided natural ventilation is a simple and energy-efficient method to passively cool a building, thus reducing or avoiding air-conditioning use. CFD has the potential to give detailed information about the complex flow generated by the interaction of buoyancy and wind in single-sided ventilation. In this paper, three experiments on single-sided ventilation are reproduced by CFD, using two turbulence models (RANS and LES). A detailed description of the experimental set-up, the numerical methods and the comparison method between experiments and simulations are provided. Results from RANS and LES are compared to experiments in terms of average and turbulent flow field, local airspeed, turbulence and temperature at the opening and airflow rates. The comparison shows that LES has the potential to provide more accurate results than RANS in most of the cases, capturing better the turbulent characteristics of the flow. However, the computational cost of LES is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of RANS. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Occupant thermal comfort is accessed using Fanger's comfort model. The results show that night cooling is superior to daytime ventilation. Night cooling may replace air-conditioning systems for a significant part of the cooling season in Beijing, but with a high condensation risk.

The first quality-control measures in this area were issued in 1986 (1986,  Editorial Policy Statement on Control of Numerical Accuracy ,  ASME J.

Given the continued increase in CFD related publications, and the many significant advancements in computational techniques and computer technology, it has become necessary to revisit the issue and formulate a more detailed policy to further improve the quality of publications in this area. This brief note provides specific guidelines for prospective authors for calculation and reporting of discretization error estimates in CFD simulations where experimental data may or may not be available for comparison. The underlying perspective is that CFD-related studies will eventually aim to predict the outcome of a physical event for which experimental data is not available. It should be emphasized that the requirements outlined in this note do not preclude those already published in the previous two policy statements. It is also important to keep in mind that the procedure recommended in this note cannot possibly encompass all possible scenarios or applications.},

To evaluate dispersion in a model urban street canyon, a series of tests with various street canyon aspect ratios (B/H) are presented. Both open-country roughness and urban roughness cases are considered. The flow and dispersion of gases emitted by a point source located between two buildings inside an urban street canyon were determined by the prognostic model FLUENT using four different RANS turbulent closure approximations and in the model fire dynamics simulator using a large eddy simulation methodology. Calculations are compared against fluid modeling in the Industrial Meteorological Wind Tunnel at Colorado State University. A basic building shape, the Wind Engineering Research Field Laboratory building (WERFL) at Texas Tech University, was used for this study. The urban street canyon was represented by a 1:50 scale WERFL model surrounded by models of similar dimensions. These buildings were arranged in various symmetric configurations with different separation distances and different numbers of up- or downwind buildings.

They are evaluated for their performance in predicting natural convection, forced convection, and mixed convection in rooms, as well as an impinging jet flow. Corresponding experimental data from the literature are used for validation. It is found that the prediction of the mean velocity is more accurate than that of the turbulent velocity. These models are neither able to predict anisotropic turbulence correctly nor to pick up the secondary recirculation of indoor air flow; otherwise the performance of the standard k-$\epsilon$ model is good. The RNG k-$\epsilon$ model is slightly better than the standard k-$\epsilon$ model and is therefore recommended for simulations of indoor airflow. The performance of the other models is not stable.},

The small- and full-scale experimental models were mainly used to generate data to validate numerical models. The multizone models were improving, and they were the main tool for predicting ventilation performance in an entire building. The zonal models had limited applications and could be replaced by the coarse-grid fluid dynamics models. The CFD models were most popular and contributed to 70 percent of the literature found in this review. Considerable efforts were still made to seek more reliable and accurate models. It has been a trend to improve their performance by coupling CFD with other building simulation models.

However, wind can also cause discomfort to pedestrians if its speed around a building is too high, and it can also increase energy loss in the winter. Firstly, this paper will discuss the design strategies for wind in environmental and building design. It will then compare the available techniques used to study the wind effect in building design, such as a model mockup, wind tunnel, nodal/zonal models, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Among the techniques studied, CFD seems to be one of the most attractive for building environment design, since it is the most affordable, accurate, and informative method. This chapter will also illustrate a number of architectural indoor and outdoor environment designs that have utilized CFD.

abstract = {Natural ventilation, which is in line with the concepts of sustainability and green energy, is widely acknowledged nowadays. Prevailing winds in urban areas are unavoidably modified by the increasing number of closely placed high-rise buildings that significantly modify the natural ventilation behaviour. This paper explores the effects of building interference on natural ventilation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The cross-ventilation rate (temporal-average volumetric airflow rate) of hypothetical apartments in a building cluster under isothermal conditions was examined using the standard two-equation k - ?? turbulence model. The sensitivity of ventilation rate to wind direction, building separation and building disposition (building shift) was studied. Placing buildings farther away from one another substantially promoted the ventilation rate, cancelling the unfavourable interference eventually when the building separation was about five times the building width (the optimum separation). The characteristic flow pattern leading to this behaviour was revealed. With the adoption of building disposition, the optimum separation could be reduced to three times the building width. In addition, the airflow rates could be doubled with suitable shifts. Building disposition is therefore one of the feasible solutions to improve the natural ventilation performance in our crowded environment. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

According to the first approach, a method to assess the potential cooling energy demand as well as NVC was developed though a parametrical analysis of the typical meteorological year (TMY) related to 50 reference cities representing the variety of climate zones of the Mediterranean area. Based on the second approach, the influence of local climate as well as building characteristics on NVC potential was assessed through dynamic energy simulations on an office building unit located in the 50 reference cities. The software Design Builder with EnergyPlus code was used to simulate the cooling energy reduction due to NVC over an extended period (May-October), varying building envelop physical parameters and AC/CNV configurations in a reduced sample of locations (8) selected amid the overall sample on the basis of K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger climate classification.},

abstract = {This experimental study uses a wind tunnel and scale model to investigate turbulence effects on the discharge coefficient and mean flow rate of wind-driven cross-ventilation. The approaching flows include low turbulence smooth flow and grid-generated turbulent flow. Two different cross-ventilation configurations are considered in this study: (1) two opposite walls, each with one opening, and (2) two adjacent walls, each with one opening. The discharge coefficients of different flow conditions are determined by a fan technique. It is found that the discharge coefficient is a function of Reynolds number, wind incidence angle and direction of air flow (inhale or exhale), but independent of external turbulence intensity and wall porosity. However, because the leeward pressure is affected by external turbulence, the internal pressure and inlet velocity are dependent on external turbulence when the openings are on the opposite walls. The experimental results also verify that internal pressure and mean air flow rate can be predicted once the external pressure distribution and opening areas are known, regardless of whether the openings are on opposite walls or on adjacent walls. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The rule of thumb for effective wind-driven cross ventilation suggests that the building length L should be less than five times of ceiling height H. This study uses a Large Eddy Simulation model and wind tunnel experiments to investigate the mechanism behind this rule of thumb. The numerical results reveal that the ventilation rate decreases as the building length increases. This is partly due to the pressure difference between the windward and leeward fa??ades of long buildings (aspect ratio L/. H???2.5) is smaller than that of a short building (L/H=1.25). The other reason is owing to the internal friction, which can produce a sluggish zone with low wind speed inside the building. For buildings with aspect ratio L/. H???5, the ventilation rate will be over-estimated, as much as about 20{\%}, by ventilation models that do not consider the internal resistance. The location of the external openings can also influence the ventilation rate. When the openings are located in the opposite corners of the windward and leeward walls, also due to the internal friction, the ventilation was 15.5{\%} less than that of openings on the centerline of the building. The mitigation effect of internal resistance on the ventilation rate can be quantified by a resistance model. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study uses wind tunnel experiments to investigate the wind-driven ventilation for buildings with two openings on a single wall. The exchange rates are measured by the tracer gas decay method under different external wind speeds, directions and opening sizes. The experimental results indicate that the time-averaged pressure difference across the openings is much larger than the fluctuating pressure when the wind direction is ?? = 22.5-45??, and the ventilation rate can be predicted by the orifice equation. When the wind direction is ?? = 0?? and 67.5-180??, the pressure difference across the openings is insignificant and the fluctuating pressure entrains air across the openings. The exchange rate is proportional to the root-mean-square of the pressure fluctuation. Furthermore, the dimensionless exchange rate of the shear-induced ventilation (wind is parallel to the openings) is found to be independent of the wind speed, opening area and location. The exchange rate for buildings with an internal partition is lower than that without a partition when the wind direction is ?? = 0-90??. A semi-empirical prediction model is proposed to calculate the exchange rate by incorporating the time-averaged pressure difference and pressure fluctuation. The application of the prediction model to compute the air change rate (ACH) is also discussed.},

abstract = {Practically all extant work on flows over obstacle arrays, whether laboratory experiments or numerical modelling, is for cases where the oncoming wind is normal to salient faces of the obstacles. In the field, however, this is rarely the case. Here, simulations of flows at various directions over arrays of cubes representing typical urban canopy regions are presented and discussed. The computations are of both direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulation type. Attention is concentrated on the differences in the mean flow within the canopy region arising from the different wind directions and the consequent effects on global properties such as the total surface drag, which can change very significantly by up to a factor of three in some circumstances. It is shown that for a given Reynolds number the typical viscous forces are generally a rather larger fraction of the pressure forces (principally the drag) for non-normal than for normal wind directions and that, dependent on the surface morphology, the average flow direction deep within the canopy can be largely independent of the oncoming wind direction. Even for regular arrays of regular obstacles, a wind direction not normal to the obstacle faces can in general generate a lateral lift force (in the direction normal to the oncoming flow). The results demonstrate this and it is shown how computations in a finite domain with the oncoming flow generated by an appropriate forcing term (e.g. a pressure gradient) then lead inevitably to an oncoming wind direction aloft that is not aligned with the forcing term vector.},

abstract = {Wind pressure coefficients (Cp) are influenced by a wide range of parameters, including building geometry, facade detailing, position on the facade, the degree of exposure/sheltering, wind speed and wind direction. As it is practically impossible to take into account the full complexity of pressure coefficient variation, building energy simulation (BES) and Airflow network (AFN) programs generally incorporate it in a simplified way. This paper provides an overview of pressure coefficient data and the extent to which they are currently implemented in BES-AFN programs. A distinction is made between primary sources of Cp data, such as full-scale measurements, reduced-scale measurements in wind tunnels and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and secondary sources, such as databases and analytical models. The comparison between data from secondary sources implemented in BES-AFN programs shows that the Cp values are quite different depending on the source adopted. The two influencing parameters for which these differences are most pronounced are the position on the facade and the degree of exposure/sheltering. The comparison of Cp data from different sources for sheltered buildings shows the largest differences, and data from different sources even present different trends. The paper concludes that quantification of the uncertainty related to such data sources is required to guide future improvements in Cp implementation in BES-AFN programs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Presence of external architectural structures (e.g. a loggia), and opening surfaces can all affect ventilation performances. All these factors lead to deviation in the wind-driven ventilation rates predicted by semi-empirical models (correlations). Thus, this study is focused on the effects of a loggia and window opening size on cross-flow ventilation rates estimated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). CFD has been validated on field measurements in a low-rise building, with a steady-state Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model. Ventilation performance is evaluated for buildings with or without a loggia with different opening sizes and various wind conditions. We find the presence of the loggia reduces the average air change rate by 27{\%}, except for one wind direction at which a vortex is formed in the loggia and directs the airflow into the opening. However, the empirical models based on the orifice equation fail to precisely predict the ventilation rate for large windward-side windows. Large windows should be installed on the fa{\c{c}}ade exposed to the prevailing wind, so as to enhance ventilation performance.},

Unfortunately, this added accuracy, (though much less expensive than Di- rect Numerical Simulations (DNS)) comes at a considerable computational cost increase when compared to the conventional Reynolds Average (RANS) approach. Although it is by no means the only factor leading to this increased cost, the way in which LES inter- acts with wall boundaries has been identified as the major contributor to this problem. In an attempt to address this issue, many turbulence researchers have investigated the requirements and effects of simplifying the aforementioned interaction, which has to date met with varying degrees of success. The current work aims to contribute to this effort, with the main goal of ascertaining whether LES can effectively be used in the near term to model aerodynamic flows of the type associated with automobiles. In addition to providing more accurate aerodynamic results, such a methodology should also allow the calculation of aero-acoustic noise for the problem under investigation. Large grid sizes necessitated by well resolved aerodynamic simulations of such high Reynolds number flows make them generally unfeasible given current CPU speeds. This project attempts to address this issue in two ways: firstly, through the application of approximate wall treatments and secondly through improved mesh distribution.},

abstract = {The objective of this research is to compare calculated and measured air flow distributions inside a test room which is naturally ventilated. The test room is situated in a relatively sheltered location and to visualise the resultant local wind pattern around the room for all prevailing wind directions wind tunnel trials were carried out. Both the wind tunnel and full-scale measurements show that the wind direction at the test cell was generally restricted to either a westerly or an easterly direction. To investigate air flow inside the room, the air pressures and velocities across the openings together with indoor air temperature and velocity at four locations and six different levels are measured. The experimental results demonstrate that for both winter and summer the air was entering the test room at bottom and leaving at the top louvre. Separate air flow and thermal modelling programs are used to predict the spatial distribution of the air flow and thermal comfort. The air flow distribution was predicted using a network air flow program. The predicted flow showed similar trends and the simulation results were in an agreement with the measured data. An explicit finite-difference thermal modelling simulation package was used to predict the thermal comfort indices. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

One of my aims is to give an indication of the contribution that the Journal has made to reporting research on this subject. Another aim is to provide a background for researchers who are starting out in research. There are nine areas of research that I have identified, namely:- steady envelope flow models; flow characteristics of openings; unsteady envelope flow models; internal air motion, zonal models and stratification; contaminant transport; age of air; CFD and its applications; scale modelling; full-scale measurements. For reasons given in the text, some of these topics are only very briefly mentioned. For example, the sections on contaminant transport and CFD are relatively brief, partly because they are the subject of other papers in this issue. (Similarly, the feasibility of natural ventilation relies on the adaptability of the occupants to be comfortable, but thermal comfort is not covered at all here, because it too is the subject of other papers.) The paper concludes with a few personal comments on the design process, since the underlying aim of research is to minimise the risks associated with naturally ventilated buildings.},

abstract = {The design of natural ventilation in buildings is often performed by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, whose application is gaining popularity. In the present study, Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANS) approach is applied to wind driven natural ventilation in a cubic building. Two different models are considered, namely the two-equation k-?? model and the Renormalization Group (RNG) theory. The velocity and pressure distribution inside and around the building are determined, as well as the ventilation rate, for three different configurations: cross ventilation, single-sided ventilation with an opening on the windward wall and single-sided ventilation with an opening on the leeward wall. The numerical results are compared with experimental data, showing a good agreement, particularly when using RNG. The discrepancy in the determination of the ventilation rate is reasonable and the flow distribution inside the building is properly described when RNG model is used. However, the k-?? model fails to determine the correct velocity components near the horizontal surfaces. According to these results, the RNG model can be considered a useful tool for the study of wind driven natural ventilation, especially for the assessment of the ventilation rate and of the air distribution inside a room. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The building studied is located in a coastal area of Corsica and mostly affected by thermal breezes phenomena which lead to high airflow rate during day (between 8 and 30 ACH) and lower during night (between 2 and 8 ACH). The first aim of this work is to set up a method in order to measure continuously the airflow rate in cross ventilation configuration using a minimal number of sensors. Our methodology involves direct measurements of velocity on a mesh and use of statistical methods. The second objective is to develop and evaluate different airflow modeling approach in cross natural ventilation configuration. Various levels of complexity are tested and compared: empirical modeling, model calibration and behavioral modeling based on artificial neural networks. In terms of error, the artificial neural network appears to be the best compromise to model the airflow rate and allow to reach a MAE of 1.75 ACH with a one minute time step. Suggested model in this paper can be coupled with a thermal model and is suitable for model based natural ventilation control.},

Hot and humid environmental conditions throughout the year and personal adaptation could have an effect on expectation and perception about TC. Through an extensive field survey conducted in residential buildings in Indonesia, 525 sets of data had been gathered. The data analysis revealed that the PMV equation had predicted warmer thermal perception as compared to what people actually felt. Interestingly, it was observed that under hot and humid tropical climate, people indicated preference to cooler environment as compared to what the neutral temperature has shown. The study also investigated the occupant's adaptive control preferences in creating a more thermally comfortable living environment. The reciprocal effects of occupant's thermal perception and behavioural adaptation were explored. In tropical free-running buildings where the air temperature and humidity might not be modified easily without mechanical means, the people seemed to prefer higher wind speed. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The air change effectiveness (ACE), an indicator of the indoor airflow pattern, was measured in twenty-six laboratory experiments. Ventilation air was supplied through inductiontype diffusers located in the ceiling and removed through a ceiling-mounted return grille. The tracer gas stepup measurement procedure was employed. In five of the experiments, pollutant removal efficiencies were also measured for simulated pollutant emissions from the floor covering and for simulated emissions from occupants. In experiments with heated supply air, supply air flow rates typical of the minimum supply flow rates of VAV ventilation systems, and 100{\%} outside air, the ACE ranged from 0.69 to 0.89. These results indicate that significant short circuiting of ventilation air between the supply air diffuser and return air grille does occur under these adverse conditions. Mechanical recirculation of air, such that the supply air contained approximately 50{\%} outside air, increased the ACE by about 0.05. When the supply air was cooled, the ACE ranged from 0.99 to 1.15, adding to existing evidence that short circuiting is rarely a problem when the building is being cooled. The pollutant removal efficiency for simulated pollutant emissions from the floor covering (PREfloor)was strongly correlated with ACE (R2 = 0.98) and the values of PREfloor were within approximately 0.1 of the values of ACE. The pollutant removal efficiency for simulated pollutant emissions by occupants varied between workstations and was not as well correlated with the ACE.},

The value of Sc has implications for the measurement of trace gas emissions, and there is a broad range of reported values for the atmospheric surface layer. During our experiment Sc averaged 0.6, with large variability between observation periods. The standard deviation in Sc was 0.31, with no obvious correlation to atmospheric conditions. Some of this variability is due to measurement uncertainty, but we believe it also reflects true variability in Sc. We show that flux-gradient formula, which assume higher values of Sc, underestimate the true tracer emission rate Q. We also show that a dispersion model with Sc = 0.6, does better at inferring Q than a model with Sc = 0.45.},

abstract = {The particular conditions of air circulation inside large open pit mines under intense insolation, dominated by mechanical and buoyant effects, are crucial when studying the dispersion of pollutants inside and outside the pit. Considering this, we study this problem using CFD tools able to include the complex geometry characterizing it and the different processes affecting circulation: flow interaction with obstacles, buoyancy, stratification and turbulence. We performed simulations using a previously developed OpenFOAM solver, focusing in the particular case of Chuquicamata, a large open pit mine ({\~{}}1. km deep) located in northern Chile. Both idealized and real topographies were used. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used LES to incorporate it in the calculation, using a DES approach to solve the flow near walls.The results from the idealized cases support the idea that buoyant currents foster the exit of particles from the pit and increase the turbulence inside its atmosphere, modifying the purely mechanical recirculatory flow inside the cavity. Differences in the air circulation and dispersion of particles between idealized and non-idealized cases are reported. In particular, there are changes in the intensity and location of the recirculation inside the pit due to variations in the aspect ratio (length/depth) of the cavity along the axis perpendicular to the main flow. Also, the topography surrounding the mine affects the main flow that sweeps the cavity, channeling it along the main axis of the pit and forcing it to enter the cavity through the lower level of the top edge. As a consequence, the patterns of pollutant transport observed in the idealized cases, dominated by near-wall upward currents, are different than those observed in the cases with complex topography, where the dispersion is dominated by internal buoyant upward currents. Anyhow, whether by internal or near wall upward currents, in all buoyant cases considered a large percentage of the particles injected inside the pit leaves the cavity.Further experiments studying the effect of 3D aspect ratio over the mechanically forced internal flow are needed to fully understand the effect of the internal geometry of the pit over the flow. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {CFD is a very important tool in today's design of automotive air induction systems. The simulations enable the flow in a proposed design to be evaluated without manufacturing the system. Most commercial software's used for this are expensive, and in the ever increasing competition lowering costs is a key issue for a carmaker such as Volvo Car Corporation. This thesis evaluates the use of the open source CFD code OpenFOAM for simulating the flows in air induction systems. Two test cases are used and compared to the commercial code Fluent sold by ANSYS, Inc. The results from both codes are also compared to results from physical tests. Results from the test cases are that although a lot of time has been spent on finding viable numerical schemes and solver settings, there is still a lot of work to be done before the OpenFOAM simulations show the same numerical stability as the Fluent simulations. Because of this and that the same boundary conditions could not be used OF shows results further from the experimental results than Fluent. During the project a problem in OpenFOAM concerning oscillating velocities in the interface to porous media was discovered. Put together there is still work to be done before OpenFOAM can be used for complete air induction system simulations. When there is no air filter involved, OpenFOAM is very suitable to use in topology optimi- sation. Since it is command line based it is easy to couple with optimisation software such as modeFrontier. Also investigated in this thesis is the adjoint solver in OpenFOAM. It is a simple adjoint optimiser but to be truly usable it needs extension. Adjoint optimisation in general is very useful as a guide to designers, but the results are not suitable to use directly since it doesn't take variables such as manufacturability into account.},

The task is to test several RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) models on two different case geometries and compare the results with LES and experimental data. The first is two dimensional, constructed for flow separation at a sharp edge. The second is three dimensional and flow separation occurs at a smooth surface. The models tested are implemented in the open source CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) program, OpenFOAM. OpenFOAM uses the finite volume method and the SIMPLE algorithm as solution procedure. The main flow features evaluated is the shape, position and size of the flow separation. Most of the models tested have problems describing the complex dynamics of flow separation in these particular cases. In addition to the simulations, the RANS k-epsilon turbulence model is presented and the RANS equations and the equation for the turbulent kinetic energy are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. The theory behind wall functions is described and these equations together with the equations in the k-epsilon model are compared with the equations implemented in OpenFOAM.},

However, external wind flow can have significant effects on buoyancy-driven natural ventilation. Simulation has been carried out for combined wind- and buoyancy-driven natural ventilation of a building with two wings of offices and a central atrium. Results show that wind would adversely affect the air flow patterns in the building designed with buoyancy-driven natural ventilation. Wind can simultaneously assist and oppose buoyancy in the windward and leeward wings, respectively, whereas buoyancy can oppose wind-driven flow in both wings. To achieve or maintain a desired environmental quality in the naturally ventilated building would require intelligent control of ventilation openings and/or careful consideration of winddriven ventilation at the design stage. The importance of measurements of variables such as pressure, velocity and temperature for real size buildings is also highlighted.},

A numerical method for the determination of the effective depth is described. The numerical method is based on the CFD technique involving the governing equations for air flow and the transport equation for the local mean age of air. The renormalization group k-?? model of turbulence is used with equations for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy to predict turbulent buoyancy-induced room air movement. The air flow through a large opening is derived from the Bernoulli theory. The predicted air flow pattern, air temperature and local mean age of air are used to determine the effective depth of fresh air distribution in a naturally ventilated room with a window opening for summer cooling. It is shown that the effective depth for thermal comfort may not coincide with that for air quality and in summer, the requirement for thermal comfort is the limiting factor to the effective room depth. The effects of window opening levels and room heat gains on the air flow rate and effective depth are investigated.},

abstract = {Two computational domains have been used for simulation of buoyancy-driven natural ventilation in vertical cavities for different total heat fluxes and wall heat distributions. Results were compared between cavities with horizontal and vertical inlets. The predicted ventilation rate and heat transfer coefficient have been found to depend on the domain size and inlet position as well as the cavity size and heat distribution ratio. The difference in the predicted ventilation rate or heat transfer coefficient using two domains is generally larger for wider cavities with asymmetrical heating and is also larger for ventilation cavities with a horizontal inlet than those with a vertical inlet. The difference in the heat transfer coefficient is generally less than that in the ventilation rate. In addition, a ventilation cavity with symmetrical heating has a higher ventilation rate but generally lower heat transfer coefficient than does an asymmetrically heated cavity. A computational domain larger than the physical size should be used for accurate prediction of the flow rate and heat transfer in ventilation cavities or naturally ventilated buildings with large openings, particularly with multiple inlets and outlets. This is demonstrated with two examples for natural ventilation of buildings. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Particle dispersion and deposition in man-made enclosed environments are closely related to the well-being of occupants. The present study developed a three-dimensional drift-flux model for particle movements in turbulent indoor airflows, and combined it into Eulerian approaches. To account for the process of particle deposition at solid boundaries, a semi-empirical deposition model was adopted in which the size-dependent deposition characteristics were well resolved. After validation against the experimental data in a scaled isothermal chamber and in a full-scale non-isothermal environmental chamber, the drift-flux model was used to investigate the deposition rates and human exposures to particles from two different sources with three typical ventilation systems: mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), and under-floor air distribution (UFAD). For particles originating from the supply air, a V-shaped curve of the deposition velocity variation as a function of particle size was observed. The minimum deposition appeared at 0.1-0.5 ?? m. For supermicron particles, the ventilation type and air exchange rate had an ignorable effect on the deposition rate. The movements of submicron particles were like tracer gases while the gravitational settling effect should be taken into account for particles larger than 2.5 ?? m. The temporal increment of human exposure to a step-up particle release in the supply air was determined, among many factors, by the distance between the occupant and air outlet. The larger the particle size, the lower the human exposure. For particles released from an internal heat source, the concentration stratification of small particles (diameter {\textless} 10 ?? m) in the vertical direction appeared with DV and UFAD, and it was found the advantageous principle for gaseous pollutants that a relatively less-polluted occupied zone existed in DV and UFAD was also applicable to small particles. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Throughout the world, there is an increasing interest in ecological design of buildings, and natural ventilation has proved to be the most efficient low-energy cooling technique. Its practical application, however, is hindered by the lack of information on the complex relationship between the building and its urban environment. In this book, a team of experts provide first-hand information and tools on the efficient use of natural ventilation in urban buildings. Key design principles are explained, enabling readers to decide on the best solution for natural ventilation of buildings, taking into account climate and urban context. In the initial sketches, architects need answers to open problems such as 'what kind of solution to adopt' and 'how to modify existing strategies to exploit the potential of the site'. This book formalizes the multi-criteria analysis of candidate solutions based on quantitative and qualitative estimation of the driving forces (wind and buoyancy), as well as of the barriers induced by the urban environment (wind speed reduction, noise and pollution) and gives a methodology for optimal design of openings. The book is accompanied by a FREE CD, containing software for assessing the potential of a given site, estimating wind speed and dimensioning the openings for natural ventilation. The methodologies and tools are tested, self-contained and user friendly. About the editors The editors, Cristian Ghiaus and Francis Allard, are affiliated with the University of La Rochelle, France.

abstract = {Large-Eddy Simulation of near-field pollutant dispersion from stacks on the roof of a low-rise building in downtown Montreal is performed. Two wind directions are considered, with different wind-flow patterns and plume behavior. The computed mean concentration field is analyzed by means of the convective and turbulent (including subgrid-scale) mass fluxes. This decomposition provides insight into the dispersion process and allows an evaluation of common turbulent transport models used with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach, such as the standard gradient-diffusion hypothesis. Despite the specific character of the flow and dispersion patterns due to the complex geometry of the urban area under study, some similarities are found with the generic case of dispersion around an isolated simple building. Moreover, the analysis of dispersion in downtown Montreal is facilitated by the physical insight gained by the study of the generic case. In this sense, the present study supports the use of generic, simplified cases to investigate and understand environmental processes as they occur in real and more complex situations. Reciprocally, the results of this applied study show the influence on the dispersion process of the rooftop structures and of the orientation of the emitting building with respect to the incoming wind flow, providing directions for further research on generic cases.},

abstract = {When undertaking wind engineering problems such as urban pollutant dispersion or pedestrian wind comfort with Computational Fluid Dynamics, an accurate simulation of the flow-field around buildings is required. In this respect, the good performance of Large-Eddy Simulation has already been established but because the formulation and the use of this turbulence modeling approach are complex, the uncertainty on the results is relatively high. This implies the need for Validation and Verification (V{\&}V) studies like the one performed in the present paper for the wind flow around an isolated high-rise building with aspect ratio 1:1:2. In the first part of the study, the numerical results are compared with measurements from a reference wind-tunnel experiment and the agreement is quantified by validation metrics. The vortex method to generate inflow turbulence is shown to provide accurate results. Unexpectedly, the best agreement with the experiments is obtained on the coarsest computational grid, with 20 cells per building side, while a finer grid with 30 cells per building side over-estimates the turbulent kinetic energy measurements. A similar result was also found by earlier studies for different flow configurations. In the second part of the study, solution verification is performed. The Systematic Grid and Model Variation technique is used to provide estimates of the modeling and numerical error contributions. The LES{\_}IQ indicator shows that a grid with 20 (resp. 30) cells per building side allows resolving 80{\%} (resp. 91{\%}) of the total turbulent kinetic energy in the region around the building. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper quantified the influence of the urban neighborhood on the degradation of Coefficient of Performance (COP) for the building cooling systems. Urban microclimate usually creates higher air temperatures in dense urban areas compared to surrounding rural and suburban regions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) combined with building energy simulations can predict local hourly temperatures in urban environments. This study uses open source software packages, including OpenFOAM and EnergyPlus, to calculate local air temperatures and heat fluxes on the building surfaces as well as resultant operational COP values. First, the simulated temperature calculations of local airflow temperatures are indirectly validated using on-site field measurements in an actual urban neighborhood. Further, the validated CFD simulations predicted local air temperatures in uniform neighborhoods of varying density. This study identified four types of COP equations to quantify performance of cooling systems as a function of outdoor air temperatures. The study findings indicate that for the present study's climate and flow conditions, rooftop air conditioners in urban areas can have a reduction in COP up to 17{\%}, compared to COP in a corresponding rural area. Window air conditioners can have reductions in COP of over 16{\%}, if located on the windward walls. However, this average COP degradation for the cooling systems installed on the leeward walls is not significant. Overall, the effect of neighborhoods on the performance of cooling systems is significant and quantifiable, and this quantification requires consideration of the common local design practices for the installation of building cooling systems.},

abstract = {The ventilation performance of a naturally ventilated classroom was investigated to monitor the CO2 levels and compare compliance with new guidelines. Measurements of CO2 levels were taken for 1 week during the heating season while different ventilation modes were investigated. The classroom was shown to have adequate ventilation to provide compliance with current recommendations although thermal comfort was sometimes compromised. Trickle ventilation provided useful ventilation at a rate of 0.75 l s-1 per person. Purge ventilation was shown to reduce the CO2 concentration by 1000 ppm but would not be sufficient to maintain an acceptable level. Experimental measurements showed that the trickle ventilators provided useful background ventilation at a total classroom rate of 22.9 l s-1 or approximately 0.75 l s-1 per person which is not enough on its own. Night time use of trickle ventilators for reducing day time CO2 concentration level is not beneficial since the classroom returns to ambient concentration levels by the time the room is used again. Hence energy savings could be made by reducing the overnight background ventilation during heating period. The teaching staff and pupils control the ventilation into the classrooms by thermal comfort rather than air quality. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The resultant airflows are influenced both by building characteristics, the resistance of the openings to flow, the inertia of the air mass in the openings and the compressibility of room air, and by frequency characteristics of wind pressures, their power spectra and the correlation among them. A new approach using the spectrum analysis technique is proposed to model the pulsating flows through openings of a building. The governing equations for fluctuating airflow behaviour are obtained from the pressure/force balance between the turbulence pressure differences across openings and the forces required to overcome the flow resistance and inertia of air. The proposed approach is applied to a single-zone enclosure with a single opening and with two openings, and can be easily extended to multi-zone buildings. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Well planned natural ventilation strategies and systems in the built environments may provide healthy and comfortable indoor conditions, while contributing to a significant reduction in the energy consumed by buildings. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is particularly suited for modelling indoor conditions in naturally ventilated spaces, which are difficult to predict using other types of building simulation tools. Hence, accurate and reliable CFD models of naturally ventilated indoor spaces are necessary to support the effective design and operation of indoor environments in buildings. This paper presents a formal calibration methodology for the development of CFD models of naturally ventilated indoor environments. The methodology explains how to qualitatively and quantitatively verify and validate CFD models, including parametric analysis utilising the response surface technique to support a robust calibration process. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a naturally ventilated study zone in the library building at the National University of Ireland in Galway. The calibration process is supported by the on-site measurements performed in a normally operating building. The measurement of outdoor weather data provided boundary conditions for the CFD model, while a network of wireless sensors supplied air speeds and air temperatures inside the room for the model calibration. The concepts and techniques developed here will enhance the process of achieving reliable CFD models that represent indoor spaces and provide new and valuable information for estimating the effect of the boundary conditions on the CFD model results in indoor environments. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Air infiltration rates directly impact building energy consumption to a larger or smaller degree depending on the tightness of building enclosure and heating ventilation and air conditioning system operation. The relative importance of infiltration airflows has been increasing in total building energy consumption due to the improvements in building insulation and window products. The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of building energy simulations associated with different air infiltration rates calculation approaches. This study used different sources of infiltration rate: time-dependent simulated data, AIVC database, and default settings in building energy simulations. A coupled framework associated with time-dependent infiltration rates is used by integrating computational fluid dynamics and multizone airflow modeling results into energy simulations. This framework is demonstrated with a case study for an office building in Michigan. The case study also uses the infiltration rates obtained from the database and default settings in energy simulation program. The comparison between simulation results and utility data shows that time-dependent infiltration rates could increase the accuracy of energy simulations with 3-11{\%} reduction in the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE), and 2-11{\%} reduction in the normalized mean bias error (NMBE).},

abstract = {The k-??{\{}lunate{\}} model is routinely used by wind engineers to computationally model the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Commercial software is typically used, with the default law of the wall used to model the rough ground surface. By setting appropriate profiles for wind velocity and the turbulence quantities at the inlet, it is often assumed that the boundary layer will be maintained up to the buildings or obstructions in the flow. This paper shows that this is not the case, even in the absence of obstructions, and that the velocity and turbulence profiles decay along the fetch under these default conditions. By revisiting previous work, it is shown that the neutral ABL can be maintained along a lengthy fetch but only with a modified law of the wall and with a shear stress applied to the top boundary of the domain. For those practitioners who are not able to adopt this more thorough approach, some measures are suggested to mitigate the decay of the boundary layer. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stack ventilation and wind-induced ventilation are the two main methods for inducing natural ventilation. Stack ventilation by itself cannot create enough air flow to achieve good indoor air quality for building occupants under hot and humid climatic conditions. The low performance of stack ventilation in hot and humid climate is due to the low temperature differences between indoor and outdoor temperature of a building. On the other hand, the wind-induced ventilation method performance is independent of low temperature difference. Therefore, it has potential use to improve the indoor air quality for buildings in the hot and humid climate. This paper examines the wind-induced natural ventilation tower performs under hot and humid climate. The study reveals that the wind-induced ventilation tower has higher extraction airflow rate comparing to other wind ventilators in the market. Analysis shows the wind-induced natural ventilation tower can produce high air changes per hour (ACH) for indoor building environment in the hot and humid climate. Study results also show the wind-induced ventilation tower's extraction flow rate is 10,000 m 3/h at external wind velocity of 0.1 m/s. With the same external wind velocity, it produces average of 57 ACH. The results of this study will be useful for designing wind-induced natural ventilation tower in hot and humid climate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Effective building performance simulation can reduce the environmental impact of the built environment, improve indoor quality and productivity, and facilitate future innovation and technological progress in construction. It draws on many disciplines, including physics, mathematics, material science, biophysics and human behavioural, environmental and computational sciences. The discipline itself is continuously evolving and maturing, and improvements in model robustness and fidelity are constantly being made. This has sparked a new agenda focusing on the effectiveness of simulation in building life-cycle processes. Building Performance Simulation for Design and Operation begins with an introduction to the concepts of performance indicators and targets, followed by a discussion on the role of building simulation in performance-based building design and operation. This sets the ground for in-depth discussion of performance prediction for energy demand, indoor environmental quality (including thermal, visual, indoor air quality and moisture phenomena), HVAC and renewable system performance, urban level modelling, building operational optimization and automation.Produced in cooperation with the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA), and featuring contributions from fourteen internationally recognised experts in this field, this book provides a unique and comprehensive overview of building performance simulation for the complete building life-cycle from conception to demolition. It is primarily intended for advanced students in building services engineering, and in architectural, environmental or mechanical engineering; and will be useful for building and systems designers and operators. -- Cover.

abstract = {Natural ventilation design is one of the most effective strategies for designing green buildings. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy should be considered to balance its benefits with its higher initial costs. In addition, it is becoming increasingly important to discuss the potential energy savings. For this purpose, quantitative evaluations are valued during the early stages of building planning and design because a building's shape can have large impacts on the performance of natural ventilation. However, few studies have fully examined the criteria for this type of evaluation. In this paper, a target air change rate is proposed as a desired criterion. The target air change rate is defined as the point where the gradient of the increase in the cooling effect from natural ventilation reaches a maximum. Above this point the rate of improvement in building comfort is more modest. In addition, this paper provides maps of indices for the United States. The maps help architects obtain a clear understanding of their design directions, e.g., a carefully designed natural ventilation strategy is highly recommended for building projects in warm-dry climates, where the internal gains are moderate, and for building projects in cold climates, where the internal gains are very high.},

abstract = {The provision of fresh air in cities is one of the main drivers for sustainability, helping to preserve occupants' health and comfort both indoors and outdoors. Moreover, it is well known that there is a crucial correlation between the natural ventilation potential (NVP) and the composition of urban morphology in built environments. However, only limited information on natural ventilation design within cities is available to local authorities and designers when considering urban planning strategies, and this is having a crucial influence on subsequent building design. This paper explains the ideas and problems associated with such research and the strategies to be undertaken. Using up-to-date Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) programmes, strategic guidelines and standards for urban morphology, microclimate and energy density can be identified and represented in a series of GIS-based climate maps. The methodology adopted for this study may be applied generally to provide data in other locations which will make a significant contribution to evidence-based policy-making and management.},

Two concepts, sustainable urban design and TOD (transit oriented development), were integrated to develop a new planning approach called the original Green-TOD. Among the key issues of Green-TOD, the relation between pedestrian space design and air ventilation is a crucial issue for providing pedestrians with amenities in a tropical climate like Kaohsiung. In this study, wind speed and wind direction, which were selected from the two main high traffic periods during the summer, served as the primary simulation settings of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and wind distribution between roadside-based and street-block-based developments were compared. Major implemented policies for urban design, including the incentives for floor area ratio (FAR), building mass and layout, and open space design measures, are explicitly addressed as well. The results of the CFD simulation show the quality of the ventilation can be improved through land-use control measures.},

abstract = {Traditional methods using steady-state simulations with RANS models may predict adequate flow characteristics of cross ventilation, provided the selected turbulence model, boundary conditions and level of mesh resolution are appropriate. However, these methods are less satisfactory if we are more interested in the statistical description of fluctuating flow rate. This study used a LES method to investigate the fluctuating flow rate induced by wind with a CFD code capable of generating time-dependent and unsteady inflows. Simulations were carried out for two wind directions: normal to the openings (case 1) and parallel to the openings (case 2). The results were in good agreements with experimental data. For case 1, the observed flow rate was relatively steady, whereas for case 2, it exhibited very unsteady phenomena. Observations indicated that the flow pattern around the building significantly affected the ventilation flow rate. For case 1, mean flows were dominant in the air exchange process, whilst for case 2 the fluctuating flows appeared to have more influence on the ventilation mechanism. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Commercial wind towers have been the focus of intensive research in terms of their design and performance. There are two main forces which drive the flow through these devices, external wind and buoyancy due to temperature difference. This study examines the relationship between these two forces and the indoor ventilation rate achieved. The work uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to isolate and investigate the two forces and draw comparisons. The study found that as expected the external driving wind is the primary driving force providing 76{\%} more internal ventilation than buoyancy driven flow, which is deemed secondary. Moreover the study found that the effect of buoyancy is insignificant without an external airflow passage other than the wind tower itself. The addition of an external airflow passage such as a window in combination with buoyancy force increased the indoor ventilation by 47{\%}. Therefore the careful positioning of windows in conjunction with internal heat source has the potential to overcome the lack of external wind driven forces in dense urban environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper describes the fluid mechanics of natural ventilation by the combined effects of buoyancy and wind. Attention is restricted to transient draining flows in a space containing buoyant fluid, when the wind and buoyancy forces reinforce one another. The flows have been studied theoretically and the results compared with small-scale laboratory experiments. Connections between the enclosure and the surrounding fluid are with high-level and low-level openings on both windward and leeward faces. Dense fluid enters through windward openings at low levels and displaces the lighter fluid within the enclosure through high-level, leeward openings. A strong, stable stratification develops in this case and a displacement flow is maintained for a range of Froude numbers. The rate at which the enclosure drains increases as the wind-induced pressure drop between the inlet and outlet is increased and as the density difference between the exterior and interior environment is increased. A major result of this work is the identification of the form of the nonlinear relationship between the buoyancy and wind effects. It is shown that there is a Pythagorean relationship between the combined buoyancy and wind-driven velocity and the velocities which are produced by buoyancy and wind forces acting in isolation. This study has particular relevance to understanding and predicting the air flow in a building which is night cooled by natural ventilation, and to the flushing of gas from a building after a leak.},

The unsteady flow around square cylinder and over a wall-mounted cube are simulated and compared with experimental data. For the cube case, none of the previously published numerical predictions obtained by steady-state RANS produced a good match with experimental data. However, evidence exists that coherent vortex shedding occurs in this flow. Its presence demands unsteady RANS computation because the flow is not statistically stationary. The present study demonstrates that unsteady RANS does indeed predict periodic shedding, and leads to much better concurrence with available experimental data than has been achieved with steady computation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Recent technology developments, markets and energy-related events have asserted their capacity to influence global energy systems. They have also reinforced the central role of policy in the increasingly urgent need to meet growing energy demand while addressing related concerns for energy security, costs and energy-related environmental impacts. Radical action is needed to actively transform energy supply and end use. In addition to analysing the global outlook to 2050 under different scenarios, across the entire energy system for more than 500 technology options, ETP 2014 explores pathways to a sustainable energy future in which policy support and technology choices are driven by economics, energy security and environmental factors. Starting from the premise that electricity will be an increasingly important vector in energy systems of the future, ETP 2014 takes a deep dive into actions needed to support deployment of sustainable options for power generation, distribution and end-use consumption. ETP 2014 analyses three possible energy futures to 2050:   6oC Scenario (6DS), where the world is now heading with potentially devastating results   4oC Scenario (4DS) reflects stated intentions by countries to cut emissions and boost energy efficiency   2oC Scenario (2DS) offers a vision of a sustainable energy system of reduced greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Status and recent trends are highlighted in Tracking Clean Energy Progress, providing a snapshot of advances or lack of progress in major low-carbon energy technologies. Collectively, ETP 2014 lays out the wide range of necessary and achievable steps that can be taken in the near and medium terms to set the stage for long-term energy policy objectives, clearly identifying the roles of energy sector players, policy makers and industry.},

abstract = {Thermal comfort research in India is in its nascent stage. Indian codes specify uniform comfort temperatures between 23 and 26????C for all types of buildings. About 73{\%} of energy in Indian residences is consumed for ventilation and lighting controls. Therefore, a thermal comfort field survey was conducted in apartment buildings in Hyderabad, which included information on the use of building controls. The present analysis is based on this database. Due to the poor availability of adaptive opportunities, 60{\%} of the occupants were uncomfortable in summer. The comfort range obtained (26.0-32.5????C) was way above the standard. The occupants adapted through clothing, metabolism and the use of various controls like windows, balcony and external doors and curtains. The subjects operated the controls, as the indoor temperature moved away from the comfort band. At comfort temperature, maximum use of openings was found, which correlated robustly with indoor/outdoor temperature and thermal sensation. Use of controls was critically impeded by lack of privacy and safety and non-availability of controls. Several design and non-thermal factors, such as operation and maintenance of controls, mosquitoes, noise, and occupant's attitude, age and tenure impacted the occupant's adaptive behaviour and thermal comfort significantly. The building's 'restrained adaptive opportunity' seriously hampered the occupant's thermal satisfaction and adversely affected the sensation vote. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The performance of wind driven natural ventilation is influenced significantly by the boundary conditions set for the wind. In real conditions the wind direction is fluctuating constantly so it is important to consider this fluctuation in experiments and simulations. This paper investigates the influence of fluctuating wind direction on cross-ventilation using wind tunnel experiments with the aim of improving the evaluation accuracy for natural ventilation. A periodically fluctuating wind direction was designed and reproduced in the experiment. Rapid Response FIDs (Flame Ionization Detector) were used to monitor the concentration of tracer gas. An index named diluting flow rate (DFR) is introduced to evaluate the ventilation performance of this kind of experiment. The results indicate that the DFRs of fluctuating cases are approximately 65-100{\%} of the maximum airflow rate and DFR is influenced by the wind speed, the opening size and the wind direction fluctuation. Informed by the experimental data the mechanism of this combined influence is discussed in this paper. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Natural ventilation in buildings can create a comfortable and healthy indoor environment, and can save energy compared to mechanical ventilation systems. In building design the prediction of ventilation can be difficult; cases of wind-driven single-sided ventilation, where the effects of turbulence dominate, are particularly problematic to simulate. In order to investigate the mechanism of natural ventilation driven by wind force, large-eddy simulation (LES) is used. In the meanwhile, detailed airflow fields, such as mean and fluctuating velocity and pressure distribution inside and around building-like models were measured by wind tunnel tests and compared to LES results for model validation. Three ventilation cases, single-sided ventilation with an opening in windward wall, single-sided ventilation with an opening in leeward wall, and cross ventilation, are studied. In the wind tunnel, a laser Doppler anemometry was used to provide accurate and detailed velocity data. In LES calculations, two subgrid-scale (SS) models, a Smagorinsky SS model and a filtered dynamic SS model, were used. The numerical results from LES are in good agreement with the experimental data, in particular with the predicted airflow patterns and velocities around and within, and the surface pressures over, the models. This is considered to establish confidence in the application of the LES methods to the calculation of ventilation in buildings, in particular for single-sided ventilation cases. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

There are discrepancies between the on-site and wind-tunnel cases for the wind-pressure difference across the buildings, the eddy size behind the buildings, and the wind speed distribution inside an apartment with cross ventilation.

abstract = {Natural ventilation in buildings can create a comfortable and healthy indoor environment, and can save energy used in the mechanical ventilation systems. Two subgrid-scale models of large eddy simulation (LES), a Smagorinsky subgrid-scale (SS) model and a Filtered dynamic subgrid-scale (FDS) model, have been used to study airflow in buildings with natural ventilation. It was found that, for fully developed turbulence flow with a high Reynolds number, both the SS and FDS models provide good results. However, if the flow has both turbulent and laminar characteristics, or the wall effect is significant, the SS model performs poorly due to its constant model coefficient. The FDS model can still predict this flow correctly because its model coefficient varies over space and time according to flow types. Furthermore, for a single-sided ventilation, it is important to obtain instantaneous flow information in order to correctly predict ventilation rate and air change effectiveness. Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) modeling cannot correctly calculate the ventilation rate in this case. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the application of CFD for designing and parametric studies of wind-induced natural ventilation. The approaches employed in such applications of CFD are whole-domain and domain-decoupled CFD modelling. The domain-decoupled technique separately analyses the external airflow fields outside and internal flows inside a building. In the whole-domain approach, the outdoor and indoor airflow is modelled simultaneously and within the same computational domain. The review showed that the whole-domain approach has been more popular than the domain-decoupled approach, and with efficient computing algorithms, grid generation techniques and advances in hardware technology, can overcome the computational overhead it incurs during application. CFD has also allowed the concept of stream tube and the local dynamic similarity model (LDSM) to be used in practice. These concepts have helped in the fundamental understanding of wind-driven natural ventilation and in distinguishing flow through large openings from that of  cracks . An important and practical approach for natural ventilation design and analysis is the integration of CFD with other simulation programs such as Building Simulation (BS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Apparently, CFD is increasing its importance in sustainable building design and it is expected that more complex naturally ventilated buildings will be designed and analysed as CFD techniques continue to improve.},

abstract = {The potential for natural ventilation in building design to reduce associated building cooling and fan energy consumption makes it an area of great interest. However, its increased use is dependent on the availability of accurate modeling tools to predict its impact on a given building design. Network airflow models have been developed to predict airflows within buildings and between indoor and outdoor, which usually require user-supplied thermal conditions in a space. Because of the dependency between airflow and space temperature in naturally ventilated buildings, network airflow models need to be incorporated into whole building energy simulation models. This study reviews existing network models that may be used for natural ventilation design and investigates the capability and accuracy of four prevalent network airflow models to simulate a wide range of natural ventilation scenarios, with varying combinations of geometry and natural ventilation driving forces. Comparison of predictions with measurements obtained from literature shows that the tools are generally able to predict natural ventilation rates within 35{\%} except for the wind-driven single-sided ventilation case. The article indicates some significant needs for improvement of the network airflow model for natural ventilation applications.},

abstract = {When heat generated from facilities inside a large factory building is not discharged outside the building due to a stagnant ventilation flow, the working environment of workers becomes worse, and the cooling of high-temperature products is delayed. In this study, wind tunnel tests were conducted to investigate the natural ventilation of entrained air inside a large factory building. The scale-down factory-building models were embedded in a simulated atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), and the mean and fluctuating velocity fields were measured using a two-frame particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. For the original factory model, some of the outdoor air came in the factory building through the one-third open windward wall, while the stagnant flow region existed in the rear part of the target area. In order to improve the indoor ventilation environment of the present factory building, three different types of the louver ventilator were attached at the upper one-third open windward wall of the factory model. Among the three louver ventilators tested in this study, the ventilator model {\{}music sharp sign{\}}3 with the outer louver ($\theta$o=90 ) and the inner louver ($\theta$i=-70 ) was found to improve the natural ventilation inside the target factory-building model. It increased the flow rate of the entrained air by aligning the outer louver blades with the oncoming wind and guiding the entrained air down to the ground surface with the elongated inner louver blades. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An advanced experimental method based on particle image velocimetry (PIV) was developed to investigate the air velocity field in buildings with cross-ventilation. It was found that airflow patterns in rooms with cross-ventilation are complex and cannot be predicted by simplified macroscopic models such as the orifice equation. Inlet-to-outlet ratio and relative location of openings on a building fa??ade are important parameters to be considered, in addition to the wall porosity.

abstract = {The wind-induced ventilation performance of a building could be negatively affected by neighbouring buildings. It is therefore important to study the impact of surrounding buildings on wind flow, in order to design an effective cross ventilation system. Based on a model validation exercise, Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach was used with the SST k-$\omega$ model, and applied to a simplified cubic model with two opposite door-like openings; this model was then placed in square and staggered arrays. The results obtained were compared to those of the isolated building. Analysis of ventilation performance of different building positions within each array showed attenuation in the flow rate as the number of upstream buildings increased in a streamwise direction. However, buildings arranged in a staggered array appeared to experience higher flow rates than those in the square layout. The results of this study therefore suggest that the surrounding buildings layout has significant influence on the efficiency of wind-induced ventilation.},

A distinction is made between specific types of wind driven ventilation techniques depending on their operation and mode of engagement with the wind. For example, a static wind catcher is classified as passive; a rotating wind cowl as a directed passive technique and a rotating turbine ventilator is classified as outright active due to its constant rotation with the wind.

Selected European weather conditions were used to determine acceptable conditions for the operation of fan-assisted ventilation systems and to analyze the decentralized ventilation system's cooling and heating loads. Entire fan and pump loads of DV system are numerically calculated based on published data. Compared with a conventional centralized ventilation system, this system has shorter air transport distances and therefore entails lower pressure losses. In a decentralized system, fan speed and airflow rate are adjusted simply and effectively depending on indoor thermal conditions. A radiant panel with decentralized ventilation system (RPDV) is shown to have the lowest heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption because it not only minimizes supply and exhaust air pressure losses, but can also be operated as a fan-assisted natural ventilation system during periods when outdoor air can be used without additional thermal loads. Based on numerically calculated and measured data, this study newly adds fan and pump energy analysis of decentralized ventilation system compared to centralized ventilation systems. This study shows the fan and pump energy consumption with analysis of fan-assisted DV system considering outdoor weather condition in European climate.},

The most important findings of this work are that: - utilisation of natural ventilation in buildings has architectural consequences as well as possibilities. - natural ventilation primarily affects the facades, the roof/silhouette and the layout and organisation of the interior spaces. - the ventilation principle applied (single-sided, cross- or stack ventilation) together with the nature of the supply and extract paths, i.e. whether they are local or central, are of key importance for the architectural consequences and possibilities. - designing a naturally ventilated building is more difficult than designing a similar but mechanically ventilated building.

abstract = {This theoretical study reports on the impact of perceived indoor air quality for productivity loss in air-conditioned office buildings. A new derivation of productivity calculation model based on pollution loads and contaminant removal effectiveness is applied and the effect of the improved ventilation efficiency on productivity is estimated. The findings show that the proportion dissatisfied is a good predictor of productivity loss due to indoor air quality in different kinds of office work. It is possible to calculate the proportion dissatisfied from olf and decipol units. Productivity is possible to improve by increasing outdoor airflow rate, decreasing emissions and improving ventilation efficiency e.g. with displacement ventilation. In a case of one person per 10m 
                        2 (0.1olf/m 
                        2) and low-emitted material (0.1olf/m

                        2. Normally, the minimum admissible outdoor airflow rate is 0.5-1.5l/s per m 
                        2 in office spaces. This means that 5-9{\%} productivity loss should be accepted using the minimum airflow rate design method. With displacement ventilation, it is possible to improve indoor air quality in a manner that significantly increases productivity compared with traditional mixing system. The effect of the contaminant removal effectiveness on the productivity loss is about 0.5-2{\%} between these systems using the same airflow rate. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The main purpose of this thesis is to develop two-phase simulations using OpenFOAM. Two different situations are studied: open and closed channel flow. Different parameters are changed in each case to obtain different results, such as the inclination of the channel and the values of the velocity inlets for each phase. When dealing with the open-channel flow different inclinations are simulated and the influence of the Froude number is analyzed. The results obtained are compared with the analytical solution obtained from the Navier-Stokes equation and also with experimental results from studies done for open-channel flows. For the closed channel flow, which is studied in horizontal, vertical and inclined position, different inlet velocities are given for each phase in order to create the different flow patterns characteristic of the multiphase flow and the results obtained are compared with experiments displayed in Tailter Dukler map that gives the transition between different flow regimes. Finally, some possible future work is presented so that the person that wants to take a deeper study of the cases has some ideas to improve the simulations, ideas that could not be carried out in this study due to the lack of time and computational power. All the files used in the software can be seen in the Appendix part of the thesis so that if the reader wants to test the simulations or just apply the conditions used in this study for a similar case, can use them as a base. Moreover, a CD is enclosed with the cases run in the thesis so that they can be directly run on a computer for testing or changing for further study.},

abstract = {Exterior venetian blinds (EVBs) are widely used in commercial and residential buildings, and show a high performance level for both shading and lighting purposes. However, an EVB installed over an open window also influences natural ventilation rates. In this study, applying the pressure loss rate of an EVB to wind-driven natural ventilation rates was proposed. A mock-up building was set that the EVB was installed on the front opening. Wind generator was installed toward the front opening in order to describe wind-driven cross ventilation in a single zone. To investigate wind pressure changes through the EVB plane, 16 pressure measuring taps were installed on each of the front and back side of the EVB plane. Various wind speeds were induced toward the front opening so as to derive the pressure loss rate for the four EVB slat angle cases (0??, 45??, 90??, and no shading). The pressure loss rates for each case were derived from the field measurements. The results show that the pressure loss rates have a range of 0.22 to 0.90. In addition, the measurement results indicated that an EVB can change the air velocity by about 50{\%} based on the slat angle. Therefore, when an EVB is installed on a window opening, the effect of the EVB on wind-driven cross ventilation rate should be taken into account.},

abstract = {Analytical solutions are derived for calculating natural ventilation flow rates and air temperatures in a single-zone building with two openings when no thermal mass is present. In these solutions, the independent variables are the heat source strength and wind speed, rather than given indoor air temperatures. Three air change rate parameters ??, ?? and ?? are introduced to characterise, respectively, the effects of the thermal buoyancy force, the envelope heat loss and the wind force. Non-dimensional graphs are presented for calculating ventilation flow rates and air temperatures, and for sizing ventilation openings. The wind can either assist the buoyancy force or oppose the airflow. For assisting winds, the flow is always upwards and the solutions are straightforward. For opposing winds, the flow can be either upwards or downwards depending on the relative strengths of the two forces. In this case, the solution for the flow rate as a function of the heat source strength presents some complex features. A simple dynamical analysis is carried out to identify the stable solutions.

Under certain physical simplifications, the system is governed in steady state by a non-linear algebraic equation or a system of equations. Three examples are given here: a single-zone building with two openings, a channel with two end openings, and a two-zone building with two openings in each zone. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented. It is shown that in all three cases the flow rate exhibits hysteresis. These results have significant implications for multi-zone modelling of natural ventilation and smoke spread in buildings.

Pressure-based multi-zone formulation is made easier to implement by introducing an auxiliary concept of external pressure, which allows all the formulas to be presented in an integrated form. Multi-zone situations considered include vertically interconnected zones, and horizontally interconnected zones with same heights and different heights. The formulation includes the combined effect of wind, thermal buoyancy and mechanical ventilation, and it can be used for both external and internal large openings. A simple and easy implementation method was then presented. Single-zone and multi-zone analytical solutions are revisited or developed by the pressure-based formulations and used for the validation of the implementation method. A CFD method is also used to cross-check the implementation method in a single-zone building with very large external openings. A reasonable agreement has been found between the results predicted by the pressure-based formulation and those predicted by the analytical solutions and CFD methods.},

Three cities in northern, middle and southern Taiwan were used to represent typical subtropical weather types.

Two different temperature control strategies, fixed indoor temperature (FIT) and operative indoor temperature (OIT) were proposed and studied. A sensible cooling potential, fpc, was proposed. Different levels of fpc, namely, strong, medium, weak and not available were used to evaluate the number of days for which natural cooling, hybrid ventilation, mechanical air conditioning are to be applied to satisfy the cooling requirement.

@article{Linden1999,
abstract = {Natural ventilation of buildings is the flow generated by temperature differences and by the wind. The governing feature of this flow is the exchange between an interior space and the external ambient. Although the wind may often appear to be the dominant driving mechanism, in many circumstances temperature variations play a controlling feature on the ventilation since the directional buoyancy force has a large influence on the flow patterns within the space and on the nature of the exchange with the outside. Two forms of ventilation are discussed: mixing ventilation, in which the interior is at an approximately uniform temperature, and displacement ventilation, where there is strong internal stratification. The dynamics of these buoyancy-driven flows are considered, and the effects of wind on them are examined. The aim behind this work is to give designers rules and intuition on how air moves within a building; the research reveals a fascinating branch of fluid mechanics.},

abstract = {This paper describes the fluid mechanics of the natural ventilation of a space connected to a large body of stationary ambient fluid. The flows are driven by buoyancy differences between the interior and exterior fluids. Connections with the ambient fluid are high level and low level openings. Two main forms of ventilation are identified: mixing ventilation and displacement ventilation. Mixing ventilation occurs when the incoming ambient fluid mixes with the fluid within the space, as is, the case if dense fluid enters through a high level inlet. In this case vertical stratification is weak. Displacement ventilation occurs when dense fluid enters at low levels and displaces the lighter fluid within the space out through high level openings. A strong stable stratification develops in this case, and there is little mixing between the incoming fluid and that in the interior. Both of these modes of ventilation are studied theoretically and the results are compared with laboratory experiments. Transient draining flows which occur when a space initially contains fluid of a density different from the ambient are examined.The presence of internal sources of buoyancy allows steady states to be established, and the effects of point, line and vertically distributed sources are studied. These steady states are extensions of filling box models, with the addition of continuous exchange of fluid with the environment outside the space. A major result of this work is that the form of the stratification within the space depends on the entrainment caused by the convective elements (plumes) produced by the buoyancy sources, but is independent of the strength of the sources. The strength of the stratification and the magnitudes of the velocities do, however, depend on the source strength. The effects of opening size(s) and configurations are determined, and criteria for producing a particular stratification within the space are established. Applications of this work to the ventilation of buildings are presented.},

Thermal comfort models for natural ventilation applicable for Singapore were used for the assessment of thermal conditions. It was found that by applying natural ventilation, a thermally comfortable indoor environment can potentially be provided for a large number of hours in the year with optimum of facade designs for residential buildings (negligible heat sources).

abstract = {The convective heat transfer is an important component in the total energy balance for arrays of buildings immersed in a turbulent boundary layer. This study examines convective heat transfer coefficients (CHTC) at the external windward, leeward, lateral and top surfaces of buildings. This study uses Large Eddy Simulations (LES) with Smagorinsky-Lily model to predict CHTC and then compares the simulation results with experimental data. In addition, steady RANS including the realizable k-* and the shear stress transport k-?? turbulence models are also validated with the experimental data. However, both of these RANS models overestimated CHTC values for arrays of buildings in contrast to LES predictions. Regular arrays of cubic buildings are modeled to investigate CHTC in an urban environment, which are arranged according to different plan area densities (??p = 0.44, 0.25, 0.16, 0.11, 0.063 and 0.04). This morphological parameter (??p) represents different urban neighborhoods and it is used to characterize different flow regimes in an urban environment. The CHTC distributions are independent of the Reynolds number based on different incoming wind velocities at a height of 10 m above the ground (U10) for windward, leeward, lateral and top building surfaces. Furthermore, CHTC distributions for different ??p and U10 = 5 m/s are compared with flow characteristics in building arrays. Finally, the CHTC correlations as a function of ??p and U10 were obtained, where ??p varies from 0.04 to 0.25 and the Reynolds number ranges from 7 ?? 105 to 5 ?? 106. With the increase of the plan area densities from 0.04 to 0.25, CHTCs increases 15{\%} for the leeward surface and decreases 16{\%} for the lateral surfaces. Consequently, a total energy balance and the energy consumption predictions for a building need to take into account the urban density of the building surroundings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The dispersion of air pollutant in complex building environment has become of great concern as more and more people live in large and crowded cities. The present work is aimed at investigating the indoor air pollutant dispersion and possible cross-unit contamination with typical high-rise residential building design in Hong Kong. Experiments were performed in a boundary layer wind tunnel for a 1:30 scale model that represented a 10-story residential building in prototype. Tracer gas, simulating exhausted room air, was continuously released from three different floor levels, and its concentrations on the adjacent and opposite envelope surfaces were measured using fast flame ionization detectors, while the pressure distributions along building facade were also measured and examined under a typical incoming wind profile. By analyzing the pressure and concentration distribution, the risk of air cross-contamination was evaluated under two wind directions. The experiment results illustrated that, in the so-called re-entrance spaces, the pollutant can spread in both vertical directions, not only in the upward direction that was found under buoyancy effect, but also in the downward direction. Furthermore, dispersion can also occur in the horizontal direction, indicating a potential risk of cross-contamination in the horizontal adjacent flats could not be overlooked as well. The study on this physical process is directly useful for the purpose of prevention and control of infectious diseases outbreak in the residential environment. In the long run, the wind tunnel test data will serve to develop computational tools to assist natural ventilation design for high-rise buildings. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Hydraulic structures under turbulent flow conditions frequently involve free surface flow and interactions between air and water. This can be observed in different kinds of structures, e.g. gullies, manholes or stepped spillways. In this doctoral program, Computational Fluid Dynamics numerical models will be used to simulate flood control devices and the results validated using real scale physical models. The challenge in numerical prediction of air mixed with water is the main motivation for this study. The focus of this work is primarily the air-water interaction and a revision of the numerical models able to capture it. The interFoam solver available in the OpenFOAMTM Toolbox is chosen as the starting point of this study because it is open-source and widely used to numerically simulate such phenomena. This solver will be thoroughly investigated and some simulations involving air and water will be presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents an in situ calibrated model-based approach to the control of natural ventilation in buildings. Specifically, the potential of empirically-based and numeric air flow models is explored as part of a hybrid building controls scheme. Toward this end, two case studies are described. In one case, the underlying predictive model is based on the statistical treatment of data obtained from a set of in situ measurements in a typical office space. In the second case, a multi-zone air flow model is used to predict the fresh air volume flows into the building interior. The resulting air flow models can be used as an integrated part of a control method for natural ventilation devices to predict the implications of alternative control options. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {It takes little more than a brief look around for us to recognize that fluid dynamics is one of the most important of all areas of physicslife as we know it would not exist without fluids, and without the behavior that fluids exhibit. The air we breathe and the water we drink (and which makes up most of our body mass) are fluids. Motion of air keeps us comfortable in a warm room, and air provides the oxygen we need to sustain life. Similarly, most of our (liquid) body fluids are water based. And proper motion of these fluids within our bodies, even down to the cellular level, is essential to good health. It is clear that fluids are completely necessary for the support of carbon-based life forms. But the study of biological systems is only one (and a very recent one) possible application of a knowledge of fluid dynamics. Fluids occur, and often dominate physical phenomena, on all macroscopic (non-quantum) length scales of the known universefrom the megaparsecs of galactic structure down to the micro and even nanoscales of biological cell activity. In a more practical setting, we easily see that fluids greatly influence our comfort (or lack thereof); they are involved in our transportation systems in many ways; they have an effect on our recreation (e.g., basketballs and footballs are inflated with air) and entertainment (the sound from the speakers of a TV would not reach our ears in the absence of air), and even on our sleep (water beds!). From this it is fairly easy to see that engineers must have at least a working knowledge of fluid behavior to accurately analyze many, if not most, of the systems they will encounter. It is the goal of these lecture notes to help students in this process of gaining an understanding of, and an appreciation for, fluid motionwhat can be done with it, what it might do to you, how to analyze and predict it. In this introductory chapter we will begin by further stressing the importance of fluid dynamics by providing specific examples from both the pure sciences and from technology in which knowledge of this field is essential to an understanding of the physical phenomena (and, hence, the beginnings of a predictive capabilitye.g., the weather) and/or the ability to design and control devices such as internal combustion engines. We then describe three main approaches to the study of fluid dynamics: i) theoretical, ii) experimental and iii) computational; and we note (and justify) that of these theory will be emphasized in the present lectures.},

abstract = {Two new versions of the k-omega two-equation turbulence model will be presented. The new Baseline (BSL) model is designed to give results similar to those of the original k-omega model of Wilcox, but without its strong dependency on arbitrary freestream values. The BSL model is identical to the Wilcox model in the inner 50 percent of the boundary-layer but changes gradually to the high Reynolds number Jones-Launder k-epsilon model (in a k-omega formulation) towards the boundary-layer edge. The new model is also virtually identical to the Jones-Lauder model for free shear layers. The second version of the model is called Shear-Stress Transport (SST) model. It is based on the BSL model, but has the additional ability to account for the transport of the principal shear stress in adverse pressure gradient boundary-layers. The model is based on Bradshaw's assumption that the principal shear stress is proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy, which is introduced into the definition of the eddy-viscosity. Both models are tested for a large number of different flowfields. The results of the BSL model are similar to those of the original k-omega model, but without the undesirable freestream dependency. The predictions of the SST model are also independent of the freestream values and show excellent agreement with experimental data for adverse pressure gradient boundary-layer flows.},

@article{Menter2011,
abstract = {Turbulence is arguably the most challenging area in fluid dynamics and the most limiting factor in accurate computer simulation of engineering flows. It constitutes a classical multi-scale problem, which is far beyond human intuitive understanding and beyond resolution capabilities of even the most powerful modern parallel computers (for any foreseeable future). Turbulence has been described by Nobel-prize winning physicist Richard Feynman as the  most important unresolved problem in classical physics.  An even more pronounced quote is associated to Werner Heisenberg:  When I meet God, I am going to ask him two questions: Why relativity? And why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first.  From a more pragmatic standpoint, however, one could argue that a complete understanding of turbulence is not required (and there is actually no indication that humans can comprehend complex nonlinear problems), but a sufficiently accurate solution of the underlying equations (better, a general method for achieving those) would suffice. Such numerical methods exist and allow a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of Navier Stokes equations for all turbulence scales in space and time. However, due to the inherent scaling laws of turbulence, DNS can be applied only to very low Reynolds (Re) numbers and very simple and limited geometries. The numerical effort for DNS scales with Re3, and with technical Re numbers in the range of 104 to 109, practically no numerical solution for flows of interest to engineers can be obtained. Turbulence modeling is the attempt to develop approximate formulations that, despite our incomplete understanding and limited computational resources, allow engineers to obtain approximate solutions for their pressing technological applications. When dealing with turbulence models, keep in mind that they often need to bridge a gap of many orders of magnitude in computing power relative to DNS. The order of CPU reduction of RANS methods relative to DNS for technical applications is astronomic (easily reaching 1010 and more)   such models, therefore, are not simply  models,  but they alter and redefine the equations solved. Industrial users are often (understandably) disturbed by RANS-related inaccuracies in their CFD solution relative to data. Considering the above challenge, such differences cannot always be avoided. Finally, not all differences between numerical results and experimental data are automatically a result of turbulence modeling; there are many other sources of error (for example, Roache 1989) that should be considered before casting a judgment on a model. Industrial CFD codes have to cover a wide range of applications from aerodynamics to internal flows, flows with heat and mass transfer to inherently unsteady applications. There are numerous areas of turbulence interaction with other physical effects, like combustion or acoustics. Obviously, no single model (or modeling approach) can cover all such applications, and numerous modeling concepts need to be developed. On the other hand, it would not be appropriate to simply program an indiscriminate number of models into industrial CFD codes, as it would have severe negative effects on the user community. The first is that most models published are not  industrialstrength,  meaning they have severe weaknesses that prevent efficient use for complex problems. The most prominent limitation is numerical robustness, as many new models are applied only to generic test cases with relatively simple geometries and high-quality grids. When faced with less-optimal conditions, they often pose severe challenges to the solver and, in many cases, lead to numerical instabilities. Most models based on the low-Re $\epsilon$-equations fall into this category. Furthermore, models often feature many complex nonlinear terms, which are designed to resolve a very specific problem in generic tests, but the side effects of such terms in complex flows are not sufficiently considered. From a coding standpoint, it is desirable to limit the number of models, as otherwise implementation quality will suffer and the user cannot rely on the correct and optimal programming of equations. Support teams need to understand turbulence models to ensure proper response to customer problems in a short timeframe. An oversupply of models severely limits the engineering team's ability to properly help customers and supply best-practice advice. Finally, the different models and submodels have to work properly in combination (for example, turbulence and transition, etc.). For these reasons, it is necessary to provide a limited number of preselected models that are:   Well understood and tested   Correctly implemented and documented   Accurate for certain classes of flows   Robust even for nonoptimal grids   Interoperable with other models and submodels   Supported by test cases The interplay of technology and implementation aspects becomes even more pronounced for scale-resolving simulation (SRS) methods like scale-adaptive simulation (SAS) (Menter and Egorov 2010, Egorov et al. 2010), detached eddy simulation (DES) (Spalart 2000, Spalart et al. 2006, Strelets 2001), or large eddy simulation (LES) (Smagorinsky 1963), in which the numerical scheme has a direct impact on model accuracy. For such models, it has to be assured that the numerical method selected matches accuracy requirements of the underlying turbulence model. This paper focuses on the industrial formulation and application of turbulence models. These notes, therefore, do not attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of turbulence modeling theory; instead, they outline the current status of models used in industrial codes as well as methods with potential for the next generation of industrial applications. The material is closely aligned with the author's line of work. For basic coverage of turbulence modeling, refer to textbooks such as Durbin and Reif (2001) or Wilcox (2006).},

The second model results from a modification to the definition of the eddy-viscosity in the BSL model, which accounts for the effect of the transport of the principal turbulent shear stress.

abstract = {Knowledge of the pressure distribution on building walls is important for the evaluation of wind loads and natural ventilation. Wind-induced pressure distributions are influenced by a wide range of factors including approach-flow conditions, urban surroundings and building geometry. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be a valuable tool for determining mean wind pressure coefficients on building facades. However, while many CFD studies of mean wind pressure on buildings have been performed in the past, the vast majority of these studies focused on simple building geometries without facade details such as balconies. These details however can drastically influence the flow pattern and the overall pressure distribution on the facade. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 3D steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD for predicting mean wind pressure distributions on windward and leeward surfaces of a medium-rise building with and without balconies. The evaluation is based on a grid-sensitivity analysis and on validation with wind-tunnel measurements. It is shown that building balconies can lead to very strong changes in wind pressure distribution, because they introduce multiple areas of flow separation and recirculation across the facade. The results show that steady RANS, in spite of its limitations, can accurately reproduce the mean wind pressure distribution across the windward facade of the building. The average deviations from the wind-tunnel measurements are 12{\%} and 10{\%} for the building with and without balconies, respectively. In addition, also the important impact of the reference static pressure and the turbulence model are demonstrated. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We investigate two approaches for describing the details of airflows in large indoor spaces, for accuracy and suitability for integration with multi-zone infiltration models. One approach, called the zonal method, was developed over the last 15 years to provide an improvement over the well-mixed assumption. The second approach is the use of a computational fluid dynamics simulation using a coarse grid model of the large indoor space. We compare velocity predictions from different formulations of zonal methods and coarse-grid k-epsilon computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, to measurements, in a 2D mechanically ventilated isothermal room. Our results suggest that, when airflow details are required, coarse-grid CFD is a better-suited method to predict airflows in large indoor spaces coupled with complex multi-zone buildings, than are the zonal methods. Based on the comparison of pressure predictions from different models, we offer guidance regarding the coupling of a model of detailed airflow in large spaces to algebraic multi-zone infiltration models.},

C p is a dimensionless quantity that represents the proportionality between the wind velocity and the pressure generated on the surface of the building. Values for Cp can be obtained from full-scale building tests, wind tunnel tests, or, more commonly, from parametric equations derived from tests. The purpose of this paper is to analyze a set of wind tunnel tests and to present a new set of surface-averaged wind pressure coefficient values for low-rise buildings and a new parametric equation determined from a curve fit to the surface-averaged data. The resulting equations are compared to another popular low-rise parametric equation and another popular wind pressure coefficient database. The new parametric equation is found to fit both databases better than the older parametric equation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The prevalence of sustainable construction is increasing due to rising energy costs, improving life cycle cost and design mandate. Engineers are utilizing more passive technologies to manage building heating and cooling demands. These approaches might take the form of low energy systems such as radiant heating and cooling, or thermally active building systems. These systems often require the use of an energy intensive compression cycle somewhere in the system. Increasingly, natural ventilation is employed to leverage freely available resources such as wind and outdoor air to satisfy cooling loads and provide occupant comfort. In its most basic form, natural ventilation provides openings in the building fa{\c{c}}ade to allow fresh outdoor air in one area of the building and out another. As the fresh outdoor air passes through, heat is removed and ventilation is provided. This technology is only appropriate where climatic conditions allow. The use of mechanical heating and cooling in combination with natural ventilation, as a hybrid or mixed mode system, can extend the acceptable climate conditions where natural ventilation can be effectively applied to utilize free cooling for a large portion of the year.},

abstract = {In this study, a high-resolution frontal area density (FAD) map that depicts the surface roughness of urban Hong Kong is produced using a mapping method that takes into account the dense urban morphology and the site wind availability of the territory. Using the MM5/CALMET model simulated wind data of Hong Kong, the FAD map of three urban zones are calculated: podium (0-15. m), building (15-60. m), and urban canopy (0-60. m). The wind tunnel test data is used to correlate the FAD understanding of the three zones. The grid sensitivity test indicates that 200. m ?? 200. m is the reasonable resolution for the FAD map; the test also establishes that the lower urban podium zone yields the best correlation with the experimental data. The study further establishes that the simpler two-dimensional ground coverage ratio (GCR), which is readily available in the planning circle, can be used to predict the area's average pedestrian level urban ventilation performance of the city. Working with their inhouse GIS team using available data, it allows the planners a way to understand the urban ventilation of the city for decisions related to air paths, urban permeability and site porosity. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Outdoor spaces are air volumes between buildings that are open to atmospheric air. Surrounding build-ings hinder and alter airflow, which affect the exchange process and its quality. Given that this outdoor air is captured to ventilate a building's interior, the geometric characteristics and wind exposure of these outdoor spaces are vital to optimising these processes. One of the parameters under study is the variable wind speed. The goal of this article is to ascertain whether different wind velocities affect airflow patterns in these spaces. To this end, eight archetypal shape/volumetric cases of urban buildings are examined from an air exchange efficiency perspective. Practical application: The result is described by a mathematical expression that links the exchange efficiency with a range of wind velocities (0.75 6.00 m/s), which confirmed that this wind velocity range implies variations of only AE1.0{\%} in interior courtyards, AE1.6{\%} in adjacent exterior spaces between buildings, and AE2.4{\%} in the considered control volume.

Furthermore, a detailed description of the natural ventilation process is provided, whilst additional information regarding the induced velocity and pressure field is presented; information which cannot be easily extrapolated by experimental methodologies.

abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to investigate the natural ventilation of a climatic livestock building under different wind incidences (WIs) for three different inlet opening areas. A 1/2 scale experimental duopitch building was employed to validate, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the CFD predictions of airflow distribution. To improve the applicability of CFD to building design, a thermal comfort index called the "minimum comfort temperature" was used in this study. Results showed that ventilation rates were not at their highest when wind was blowing normal to the building because a considerable quantity of the flow exited the building via short-circuiting. However, the greatest ventilation homogeneity was experienced when the wind was blowing normal to the building, because of the formation of two wind-driven vortices within the building. Results also showed that the highest level of environmental heterogeneity occurs at WIs of 10-40?? because the primary vortex only occupies a portion of the total building volume. It was also found that in some circumstances the ventilation rate determined from the flow rate through the building openings may not accurately represent the actual ventilation rate of a building, and measurements/simulations of contaminant decay may form a more accurate measure of ventilation rate. ?? 2009 IAgrE.},

The internal turbulence spectrum of the main stream penetrating the inlet remained the same as that of the oncoming flow, but the spectra of other components were produced by the internal turbulence, whose eddy size was determined explicitly by the size of the model. The flow exiting from the outlet moved upwards due to the outside re-circulating eddy. The ventilation flow rates increased in the range of 40?? ??? 0 ??? 60?? for the incidence angle of the oncoming flow because the dynamic pressure at the inlet increased due to the change of the separated flow patterns around the model.

The method consists in running simulations with a thermal-airflow program of a household located in Vejle, Denmark during the months of June, July and August calculating the indoor air temperatures during this period. The dwelling belongs to a Danish project of passive houses named Komfort Husene where its users claim there are periods of overheating during the summer time. Then, after the simulations are validated with measured data, and by applying a new assessment method presented in this article as the cooling rate due to natural ventilation instead of a constant mechanical ventilation rate in the thermal balance within the dwelling, the energy saving is calculated. Results show that there is a reduction of 90{\%} of hours of a possible use of mechanical ventilation, showing the feasibility to achieve thermal comfort within the house by using passive ventilation. The conclusion is therefore that the results contribute to an assessment of the economic and environmental benefits of using natural ventilation rather mechanical one on large-scale scenarios located in temperate conditions.

Straight, concave and convex roof geometries are evaluated. The analysis is performed using 3D steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with the SST k-$\omega$ turbulence model. The computational grid is based on a grid-sensitivity analysis and the simulation results are validated based on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements from literature. For the single-span cases, the convex roof results in the highest volume flow rate, which is about 8.8{\%} higher than for the concave roof, and 3.5{\%} higher than the straight roof. A double-span roof performs slightly better than a single-span roof with respect to ventilation flow rates (below 4.2{\%}) in case of a straight or concave roof, but worse in case of a convex roof (-12{\%}). The internal roof geometry near the outlet opening plays an important role in the ventilation of the building. Finally, the inlet-to-outlet opening ratio has an important effect on the volume flow rates, with significantly higher ventilation flow rates for a lower opening ratio.},

abstract = {The position of window openings and roof inclination are important parameters determining the effectiveness of wind-driven cross-ventilation in buildings. Many studies on natural ventilation have been performed in the past, however, a detailed review of the literature indicates that the majority of these studies focused on flat roofs with symmetric opening positions. There is a lack of research that analyzes the impact of asymmetric opening positions and roof inclination on natural ventilation potential. This paper presents Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to analyze the natural ventilation flow in a generic isolated building with different vertical positions of the outlet opening - yielding asymmetric opening positions - and five different roof inclination angles. The simulations are performed using the 3D steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. They are based on a grid-sensitivity analysis and on validation with previously published wind-tunnel measurements using Particle Image Velocimetry. The results show that the shear-stress transport (SST) k-?? and the Renormalization-group (RNG) k-?? turbulence models provide the best agreement with the experimental data. It is also shown that the roof inclination angle has a significant effect on the ventilation flow; the volume flow rate increases by more than 22{\%}. The maximum local indoor air velocity increases considerably when the inclination angle is increased, however, the differences in the average velocity in the occupied zone are only around 7{\%}. The vertical position of the outlet opening has a relatively small impact on the volume flow rate (less than 4{\%}), and a small influence on the average velocity in the occupied zone ({\textless}5{\%}).},

The aim is to identify characteristic building parameters and to determine the night ventilation effect with these parameters. The experiments (one room with and one without night ventilation) are evaluated by using both a parametric model and the ESP-r building simulation programme.

Research in this area is steadily growing; however, there is a lack of conclusive results in available literature about energy performances related to the DSF, thus limiting a better and more informed application of this technology in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector. This article systematically reviews more than 50 articles which have dealt with the energy related performance of DSFs in temperate climates and provide a meta-analysis of the numerical findings published in the studies examined. Energy related figures are presented separately for embodied and operational energy. Specifically, the operational energy end-uses taken into account are heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation. Numerical results in the literature are normalised and expressed in form of percentage of maximum energy reduction/increment compared to a base case (e.g. a single skin case) used as a reference in the corresponding studies. Such an approach is meant to provide a reliable comparison of published figures. Key fa{\c{c}}ade parameters (DSF spatial configurations, cavity width and ventilation), building parameters (orientation and climatic areas) and the methodological approaches used in the reviewed studies were adopted as clustering criteria. Several clustering criteria present extremely spread values, indicating the necessity to further investigate, understand, and attempt to reduce such high discrepancies in operational energy performances. Additionally, and more importantly, almost no information exists on DSFs life cycle energy figures, highlighting an important gap that requires further research.},

abstract = {In the interest of designing an efficient and acceptable indoor air environment in modern buildings, it is important to resolve the relationship between geometric room parameters and the air flow patterns produced by mechanical ventilation systems. Toward this end, we compare results from relatively simple three-dimensional numerical simulations (CFD) with laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) experimental measurements of indoor air flows in a one-tenth sub-scale model room. Laminar, k- turbulence, and RNG k- turbulence numerical models are used and evaluated with respect to their performance in simulating the flow in the model room, and results of the numerical simulations and velocimetry measurements show how obstructions can greatly influence the air flow and contaminant transport in a room. It is important, therefore, that obstructions be considered in ventilation design. Simulations predict the measured trends in a model room very well, with relative errors not much larger than 20{\%}. In this study, the RNG model most accurately predicts the flow in a partitioned room, capturing the gross effects of a large flow obstruction. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With an increased awareness of sustainability issues, natural ventilation has become an elegant method for reducing the costs and environmental effects of the energy that is used to maintain comfortable indoor air quality rather than using mechanical ventilation. The windows in many industrial buildings are continuously open to exhaust pollutants and intake fresh air. Though windows are functional and efficient for natural ventilation, rainwater is able to penetrate through the windows during wind-driven rain. For industries in which the moisture content affects the quality of the product, the intrusion of a large amount of rainwater through windows must be prevented without compromising the effective ventilation. The aim of this research is to determine an innovative design for windows to accomplish the optimum of high ventilation and low rain penetration. For this purpose, windows are variously innovated and tested in full-scale measurements, reduced-scale wind-tunnel measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). An artificial rain and wind velocity to mimic the average of the maximum values in Korea are created. The maximum reduction in rain penetration of over 98{\%} compared to basic 90  open windows is attained with only a 4{\%} 9{\%} decrement of ventilation efficiency in the two recommended designs.},

abstract = {Beim Pariser Klimagipfel wurde beschlossen, die globale Erw{\"{a}}rmung m{\"{o}}glichst auf 1,5  C zu begrenzen, um die Folgen des Klimawandels noch in einem vertretbaren Ausma{\ss} zu halten. Dazu ist eine Reduktion des energiebedingten Kohlendioxidaus- sto{\ss}es gegen 2040 auf null erforderlich. Danach darf kein fossiles Erdgas, Erd{\"{o}}l und keine Kohle mehr genutzt werden oder das zu viel emittierte Kohlendioxid muss mit aufw{\"{a}}ndigen und kostenintensiven CCS-Verfahren wieder der Atmosph{\"{a}}re entzogen und endgelagert werden. Die Energieversorgung in den Sektoren Strom, W{\"{a}}rme und Verkehr sollte daher bis 2040 vollst{\"{a}}ndig mit erneuerbaren Energien gedeckt werden. Die Potenziale f{\"{u}}r Biomasse, Geothermie und Solarthermie sind in Deutschland begrenzt. Darum muss der wesentliche Anteil der k{\"{u}}nftigen Energieversorgung durch Strom aus Windkraft und Photovoltaikanlagen gedeckt werden. Bei gleichbleibenden Verhaltens- und Konsummustern steigt dadurch der Stromverbrauch von derzeit rund 600 TWh auf gut 1300 TWh an. Voraussetzung sind ambitionierte Effizienzma{\ss}nahmen. Der motorisierte Stra{\ss}enverkehr muss fast vollst{\"{a}}ndig elektrifiziert werden. Gegen 2025 m{\"{u}}ssen daf{\"{u}}r die Produktion von Fahrzeugen mit Benzin- und Dieselmotoren eingestellt und f{\"{u}}r den G{\"{u}}terverkehr wichtige Fernstra{\ss}en mit Oberleitungen versehen werden. Im W{\"{a}}rmebereich d{\"{u}}rfen ab dem Jahr 2020 keine neuen Gas- oder {\"{O}}lheizungen sowie KWK-Anlagen installiert werden. Aus Effizienzgr{\"{u}}nden wird k{\"{u}}nftig der {\"{u}}berwiegende Anteil der Raumw{\"{a}}rme durch W{\"{a}}rmepumpen gedeckt. Werden die Effizienzma{\ss}nahmen nicht umgesetzt, steigt der Strombedarf auf bis zu 3000 TWh an. Diese Strommenge in absehbarer Zeit klimaneutral zu decken ist unrea- listisch. Selbst f{\"{u}}r einen Strombedarf von 1300 TWh muss das Ausbautempo von Solar- und Windkraftanlagen deutlich steigen. Bei der Onshore-Windkraft liegt der empfohlene j{\"{a}}hrliche Nettozubau bei 6,3 GW, bei der Offshore-Windkraft bei 3 GW und bei der Photovoltaik bei 15 GW. Zur kosteneffizienten Integration dieser erneuerbaren Kraft- werksleistungen muss ein Kohleausstieg bis sp{\"{a}}testens 2030 erfolgen. Mit den heutigen Zielvorgaben aus dem Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz besteht keinerlei M{\"{o}}glichkeit, die Pariser Klimaschutzziele zu erreichen. Das ist den politischen Verantwortlichen entweder nicht bewusst oder sie nehmen ein Verletzen der Klimaschutzver- pflichtungen bewusst in Kauf oder setzen auf eine nachtr{\"{a}}gliche Korrektur durch CCS- Technologien. Da keine dieser Optionen gesellschaftlich tragbar ist, sind schnelle und einschneidende Korrekturen der Energiepolitik dringend erforderlich.},

The cooling effect of the wind helps to mitigate the adverse effects of heat island on the micro climate and human thermal comfort. This paper investigates the existence of heat island in Muar, one of the fast growing cities in southern part of Malaysia and its possible causes, and then examines the effects of different urban geometry on the wind flow. The results of this study indicate that the chaotic development in Muar has caused reduced ventilation in urban canyons. The heat island intensity in the city center was recorded as 4.  C during the day and 3.2.  C during the night. Investigation of various urban geometry modifications showed that step up configuration was the most effective geometry as it can distribute the wind evenly allowing the wind to reach even the leeward side of each building. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become one of the most important tools for the assessment of natural cross-ventilation of buildings. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of CFD simulations, solution verification and validation studies are needed, as well as detailed sensitivity studies to analyse the impact of computational parameters on the results. In a previous study by the present authors, the impact of a wide range of computational parameters on the cross-ventilation flow in a generic isolated single-zone building was investigated. This paper presents the follow-up study that focuses in more detail on validation with wind tunnel measurements and on the effects of physical and numerical diffusion on the cross-ventilation flow. The CFD simulations are performed with the 3D steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach with the SST k-?? model to provide closure. Validation of the coupled outdoor wind flow and indoor airflow simulations is performed based on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements for four different building configurations. The analysis of numerical diffusion effects is performed in two parts. First, the effect of physical diffusion is analysed by changing the inlet profiles of turbulent kinetic energy within a realistic range. Second, the effect of numerical diffusion is investigated by changing the grid resolution and by applying both first-order and second-order discretisation schemes. The results of the validation study show a good to a very good agreement for three of the four configurations, while a somewhat less good agreement is obtained for the fourth configuration. The results of the diffusion study show that the effects of physical and numerical diffusion are very similar. Along the centreline between the openings, these effects are most pronounced inside the building, and less pronounced outside the building. The velocity-vector fields however show that increased physical and numerical diffusion decreases the size of the upstream standing vortex and increase the spread of the jet entering the buildings. It is concluded that diffusion is an important transport mechanism in cross-ventilation of buildings, and that special care is needed to select the right amount of physical diffusion and to reduce the numerical diffusion, using high-resolution grids and using at least second-order accurate discretisation schemes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate CFD simulation of coupled outdoor wind flow and indoor air flow is essential for the design and evaluation of natural cross-ventilation strategies for buildings. It is widely recognized that CFD simulations can be very sensitive to the large number of computational parameters that have to be set by the user. Therefore, detailed and generic sensitivity analyses of the impact of these parameters on the simulation results are important to provide guidance for the execution and evaluation of future CFD studies. A detailed review of the literature indicates that there is a lack of extensive generic sensitivity studies for CFD simulation of natural cross-ventilation. In order to provide such a study, this paper presents a series of coupled 3D steady RANS simulations for a generic isolated building. The CFD simulations are validated based on detailed wind tunnel experiments with Particle Image Velocimetry. The impact of a wide range of computational parameters is investigated, including the size of the computational domain, the resolution of the computational grid, the inlet turbulent kinetic energy profile of the atmospheric boundary layer, the turbulence model, the order of the discretization schemes and the iterative convergence criteria. Specific attention is given to the problem of oscillatory convergence that was observed during some of these coupled CFD simulations. Based on this analysis, the paper identifies the most important parameters. The intention is to contribute to improved accuracy, reliability and evaluation of coupled CFD simulations for cross-ventilation assessment. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Outdoor ventilation is very important for a healthy and livable urban environment. It is strongly influenced by wind speed and direction, which in turn are affected by urban morphology. This paper first provides a detailed review of the literature for CFD studies of outdoor ventilation for generic urban configurations. The review indicates that there is a clear lack of studies for urban configurations where not all parallel streets have equal street widths. Next, the paper presents Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of outdoor ventilation for generic configurations with parallel streets of equal and unequal street widths. The 3D steady RANS equations with the standard k-. e{\{}open{\}} model and the passive scalar transport equation are used to calculate the effective local mean age of air at pedestrian level as an indicator of pollutant removal efficiency. The study is based on grid-convergence analysis and on validation with previously published wind-tunnel measurements. The influence of a central and wider main street on the wind-velocity pattern and on the effective local mean age of air of the surrounding area is analyzed for different wind directions. For wind directions oblique or perpendicular to the main street, the presence of this main street generally improves the ventilation efficiency because the main street acts as a sink of clean air. However, this is generally not the case for the parallel wind direction, where the higher flow rate through the main street reduces the flow rates through the parallel narrower streets, negatively affecting their ventilation efficiency.},

abstract = {There are increasing concerns regarding the quality of urban public spaces. Wind is one important environmental factor that influences pedestrians' comfort and safety. In modern cities there are increasing numbers of high constructions and complex forms which can involve problems of significant wind discomfort around these buildings. Architects and town planners need guidelines and simple design tools to take account of wind in their projects. This paper reports the progress made in using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for assessing wind comfort in urban planning. Fluent software was validated for wind studies in urban environments by comparing CFD simulation results with published wind-tunnel tests. This validation shows that mean wind velocities around buildings can be simulated numerically with a very high degree of accuracy. On the basis of the results of a large number of CFD simulations, a methodology and simple graphical tools were developed to quantify critical wind speeds around buildings. In practice these should help architects and town planners when designing our built environment. Moreover, this study shows how numerical modelling is now a high-performance tool for developing useful guidelines and simple design tools for urban planners.},

Attention is concentrated on the near-wall region, including the canopy region below the tops of the roughness elements. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler anemometry were used to identify the dominant features of the mean and turbulent flow and these are compared with the better-known features of the flow above the roughness. Spatial correlation data, extracted from the PIV images, are used to provide information about eddy structures and it is shown that these differ in some crucial respects from those typical of more classical boundary layers. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of their relevance to flows within the urban environment.},

abstract = {At the first Computational Wind Engineering conference in 1992 "Appropriate boundary conditions for computational wind engineering models using the k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model" were proposed. In this paper it is shown that these conditions can be directly derived by treating the onset flow as a horizontally homogeneous turbulent surface layer, with the flow being driven by a shear stress at the top boundary. This approach is extended to provide the inlet profiles and boundary conditions appropriate for modelling the flow using the standard k-$\epsilon$, RNG k-$\epsilon$, Wilcox k-$\omega$ and LRR QI turbulence models. Means for their application within the commercial CFD code CFX 12.0 are given. It is shown that within the flow the various turbulence model constants set the effective value of von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n's constant, which does vary slightly between models. The discrepancy between the turbulence level set by the standard turbulence model constants and that observed in the atmosphere is discussed. Problems with excessive turbulence generation near the ground and the over-prediction of stagnation pressures are discussed and possible solutions proposed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ventilation effectiveness is an indicator of the quality of supply air distribution in ventilated rooms. It is a representation of how well a considered space is ventilated compared to a perfect air mixing condition. Depending on pollutant properties and source position relative to the airflow, ventilation effectiveness can more or less successfully be used as an indicator of air quality and human exposure. This paper presents an experimentally and numerically based study that examines the relationship between ventilation effectiveness and particle concentration in typical indoor environments. The results show that the relationship varies predominantly with airflow pattern and particle properties. Fine particles (1 ??m) follow the airflow pattern more strictly than coarse particles (7 ??m), and the high ventilation effectiveness indicates better removal of fine particles than coarse particles. When a ventilation system provides high mixing in the space and ventilation effectiveness is close to one, particle sizes and source location have a relatively small effect on particle concentration in the breathing zone. However, when the supply air is short circuited and large stagnation zones exist within the space, the particle concentration in the breathing zone varies with particle size, source location, and airflow pattern. Generally, the results show that for fine particles (1 ??m), increase of ventilation effectiveness reduces occupant exposure; while for coarser particles (7 ??m), source location and airflow around the pollutant source are the major variables that affect human exposure.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the use of a Grid Convergence Index (GCI) for the uniform reporting of grid refinement studies in Computational Fluid Dynamics. The method provides an objective asymptotic approach to quantification of uncertainty of grid convergence. The basic idea is to approximately relate the results from any grid refinement test to the expected results from a grid doubling using a second-order method. The GCI is based upon a grid refinement error estimator derived from the theory of generalized Richardson Extrapolation. It is recommended for use whether or not Richardson Extrapolation is actually used to improve the accuracy, and in some cases even if the conditions for the theory do not strictly hold. A different form of the GCI applies to reporting coarse grid solutions when the GCI is evaluated from a "nearby" problem. The simple formulas may be applied a posteriori by editors and reviewers, even if authors are reluctant to do so.},

@article{Roache1986,
abstract = {Although no standard method for evaluating numerical uncertainty is currently accepted by the CFD community, there are numerous methods and techniques available to the user to accomplish this task. The following is a list of guidelines, enumerating the criteria to be considered for ar-chival publication of computational results in the Journal of Fluids Engineering. 1. Authors must be precise in describing the numerical method used; this includes an as-sessment of the formal order of accuracy of the truncation error introduced by individual terms in the governing equations, such as diffusive terms, source terms, and most impor-tantly, the convective terms. It is not enough to state, for example, that the method is based on a " conservative finite-volume formulation, " giving then a reference to a general CFD textbook. 2. The numerical method used must be at least formally second-order accurate in space (based on a Taylor series expansion) for nodes in the interior of the computational grid. The computational expense of second, third, and higher order methods are more expen-sive (per grid point) than first order schemes, but the computational efficiency of these higher order methods (accuracy per overall cost) is much greater. And, it has been dem-onstrated many times that, for first order methods, the effect of numerical diffusion on the solution accuracy is devastating. 3. Methods using a blending or switching strategy between first and second order methods (in particular, the well-known " hybrid, " " power-law, " and related exponential schemes) will be viewed as first-order methods, unless it can be demonstrated that their inherent numerical diffusion does not swamp or replace important modeled physical diffusion terms. A similar policy applies to methods invoking significant amounts of explicitly added artificial viscosity or diffusivity. 4. Solutions over a range of significantly different grid resolutions should be presented to demonstrate grid-independent or grid-convergent results. This criterion specifically ad-dresses the use of improved grid resolution to systematically evaluate truncation error and accuracy. The use of error estimates based on methods such as Richardson extrapolation or those techniques now used in adaptive grid methods, may also be used to demonstrate solution accuracy. 5. Stopping criteria for iterative calculations need to be precisely explained. Estimates must be given for the corresponding convergence error. 6. In time-dependent solutions, temporal accuracy must be demonstrated so that the spuri-ous effects of phase error are shown to be limited. In particular, it should be demon-strated that unphysical oscillations due to numerical dispersion are significantly smaller in amplitude than captured short-wavelength (in time) features of the flow. 7. Clear statements defining the methods used to implement boundary and initial conditions must be presented. Typically, the overall accuracy of a simulation is strongly affected by the implementation and order of the boundary conditions. When appropriate, particular attention should be paid to the treatment of inflow and outflow boundary conditions. 8. In the presentation of an existing algorithm or code, all pertinent references or other pub-lications must be cited in the paper, thus aiding the reader in evaluating the code and its method without the need to redefine details of the methods in the current paper. How-ever, basic features of the code must be outlined according to Item 1, above. 9. Comparison to appropriate analytical or well-established numerical benchmark solutions may be used to demonstrate accuracy for another class of problems. However, in general this does not demonstrate accuracy for another class of problems, especially if any ad-justable parameters are involved, as in turbulence modeling. 10. Comparison with reliable experimental results is appropriate, provided experimental un-certainty is established. However, " reasonable agreement " with experimental data alone will not be enough to justify a given single-grid calculation, especially if adjustable pa-rameters are involved. These ten items lay down a set of criteria by which the editors and reviewers of this Journal will judge the archival quality of publications dealing with computational studies for the Journal of Fluids Engineering. We recognize that the effort to perform a thorough study of numerical accuracy may be great and that many practical engineering calculations will continue to be per-formed by first order methods, on a single fixed grid. However, such analyses would not be ap-propriate for presentation in this archival journal. With the gains in performance of low-end workstations, it is now reasonable to require papers on solutions by CFD to meet these funda-mental criteria for archiving of a publication. With the details of these ten criteria now presented, a shortened statement will appear as fol-lows: The Journal of Fluids Engineering will not consider any paper reporting the numerical solu-tion of a fluids engineering problem that fails to address the task of systematic truncation error testing and accuracy estimation. Authors should address the following criteria for assessing numerical uncertainty. 1. The basic features of the method including formal truncation error of individual terms in the governing numerical equations must be described. 2. Methods must be at least second order accurate in space. 3. Inherent or explicit artificial viscosity (or diffusivity) must be assessed and minimized. 4. Grid independence or convergence must be established. 5. When appropriate, iterative convergence must be addressed. 6. In transient calculations, phase error must be assessed and minimized. 7. The accuracy and implementation of boundary and initial conditions must be fully ex-plained. 8. An existing code must be fully cited in easily available references. 9. Benchmark solutions may be used for validation for a specific class of problems. 10. Reliable experimental results may be used to validate a solution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Classroom ventilation rates often do not meet building standards, although it is considered to be important to improve indoor air quality. Poor indoor air quality is thought to influence both children's health and performance. Poor ventilation in The Netherlands most often occurs in the heating season. To improve classroom ventilation a tailor made mechanical ventilation device was developed to improve outdoor air supply. This paper studies the effect of this intervention.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The FRESH study (Forced-ventilation Related Environmental School Health) was designed to investigate the effect of a CO2 controlled mechanical ventilation intervention on classroom CO2 levels using a longitudinal cross-over design. Target CO2 concentrations were 800 and 1200 parts per million (ppm), respectively. The study included 18 classrooms from 17 schools from the north-eastern part of The Netherlands, 12 experimental classrooms and 6 control classrooms. Data on indoor levels of CO2, temperature and relative humidity were collected during three consecutive weeks per school during the heating seasons of 2010-2012. Associations between the intervention and weekly average indoor CO2 levels, classroom temperature and relative humidity were assessed by means of mixed models with random school-effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At baseline, mean CO2 concentration for all schools was 1335 ppm (range: 763-2000 ppm). The intervention was able to significantly decrease CO2 levels in the intervention classrooms (F (2,10) = 17.59, p {\textless} 0.001), with a mean decrease of 491 ppm. With the target set at 800 ppm, mean CO2 was 841 ppm (range: 743-925 ppm); with the target set at 1200 ppm, mean CO2 was 975 ppm (range: 887-1077 ppm).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Although the device was not capable of precisely achieving the two predefined levels of CO2, our study showed that classroom CO2 levels can be reduced by intervening on classroom ventilation using a CO2 controlled mechanical ventilation system.},

abstract = {New developments are presented in the area of grid convergence error analysis for mixed-order numerical schemes. A mixed-order scheme is defined as a numerical method where the formal order of the truncation error varies either spatially, for example, at a shock wave, or for different terms in the governing equations, for example, third-order convection with second-order diffusion. The case examined is the Mach 8 inviscid flow of a calorically perfect gas over a spherically blunted cone. This flowfield contains a strong bow shock wave, where the formally second-order numerical scheme is reduced to first order via a flux-limiting procedure. The proposed mixed-order error analysis method allows for nonmonotonic behavior in the solution variables as the mesh is refined. Nonmonotonicity in the local solution variables is shown to arise from a cancellation of first- and second-order error terms for the present case. An error estimator is proposed based on the mixed-order analysis and is shown to provide good estimates of the actual error when the solution converges nonmonotonically with grid refinement.},

Such an arrangement exploits the heat transfer between cavity air, the PV fa{\c{c}}ade and the primary wall of the building for the purpose of PV cooling in summer (with natural convection) and heat recovery in winter (mechanical ventilation). A simplified physical model of the system is proposed for the summer operating configuration, which is more challenging from a numerical perspective. The model describes the active envelop in terms of a simplified geometry, and includes parameters such as density of PV cells, relative coverage of degree of transparency/opaque surfaces, and the ratio of height/width of the double-skin. For a given set of meteorological conditions, the surface and air temperatures, mass flow rate and PV power output are obtained by solving a system of thermal and aerodynamic balance equations. Validation of the model was undertaken using experimental data from a full scale prototype system installed in Toulouse, France as part of the RESSOURCES project (ANR-PREBAT2007). Coupling of the system to a simulated building was achieved with the aid of TRNSYS, and this combined system was evaluated in terms of heating and cooling needs for a range of French climates. It was found that the cooling needs are marginally higher for all locations considered, whereas the impact of the fa{\c{c}}ade on the heating needs is weak as these needs are already low for these all locations.},

Four kitchens have been carefully selected after a detailed initial survey of the cooking arrangement and exhaust systems in all of the kitchens in the campus. For the experimental part, the concentrations of CO 2 and CO and temperature are recorded with the help of an indoor air quality measurement device named IAQ Calc7545. In each of the four kitchens, a 1.8m 1.5m vertical area was selected, which is perpendicular to the vertical side of a burner that faces the cooks, and measurements were carried out at 72 suitable grid points within this area. For the computational part, the three-dimensional fluid flow field in the kitchen of site 1 is numerically simulated by Fluent. The volume fractions of CO 2 and CO at the outlet of the burners are estimated from a separate FORTRAN code for equilibrium chemical analysis and are used as a boundary condition for the Fluent simulation. The mixture model for the multiphase flow in Fluent is used for finding the distribution of the species within the flow domain. Given the complexity of the geometry and flow field considered here, the results of CFD modelling agree well with the experiments, validating the choice of boundary conditions, grid generation and other subtleties involved. The measured and computed values are compared with the corresponding ASHRAE standard. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is also advisable to avoid having the wall-adjacent mesh in the buffer region since neither wall functions nor near-wall modeling approach accounts for it accurately. RSM predicts the flow properties more consistently because it accounts for all the Reynolds Stress components.},

abstract = {AbstractThe mechanism of cross ventilation is dealt with in this paper. The results are obtained by a combination of wind tunnel studies and CFD predictions using a Reynolds stress model as the turbulence model. All buildings have been exposed to a uniform velocity field and therefore the reference flow rate for an opening is equal to the velocity multiplied by the opening area. The openings were located at or close to the position of the stagnation point on the corresponding sealed building.The view taken in the paper is that the flow is generated by an interaction between the atmospheric boundary layer flow approaching the building and the building itself. The process starts with the undisturbed boundary layer flow and ends when the boundary layer has been fully restored. The paper begins with scrutinising the basic assumptions behind the orifice equation, the most common model for relating a pressure differential to a flow. This pressure differential is usually taken from the pressure coefficients reco...},

The air flow inside and outside the canyon as well as the air and surface temperatures inside the canyon are measured for a period of seven continuous days during the whole day and night period. The air flow characteristics inside the canyon are analyzed. For perpendicular wind speeds, the air flow inside the canyon is characterized by either a circulatory vortex driven by the ambient air flow or a double vortex flow where the upper one is driven by the ambient air flow and the lower one is driven in the opposite direction by the circulation above. When the ambient air blows parallel to the canyon, the measured wind data inside the canyon indicate a flow in the same direction. When the air flows at a certain angle to the canyon axis, the measured data indicate that a spiral vortex is induced along the canyon length. The spatial and temporal variation of the surface and air temperature distribution inside the canyon is analyzed. The heat island intensity in the canyon is estimated based on measurements from a reference station. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The specific ventilation patterns as well as the associated carbon dioxide concentrations, before, during and after the teaching period are analysed in detail. During the teaching period, only 23{\%} of the measured classrooms presented a flow rate higher than the recommended value of 8 l/p/s while the mean daily fluctuation was close to 40{\%}. About, 52{\%} of the classrooms presented a mean indoor CO2 concentration higher than 1000 ppm. The specific experimental data have been compared against existing ventilation rates and carbon dioxide concentrations using published information from 287 classrooms of 182 naturally ventilated schools and 900 classrooms from 220 mechanically ventilated schools. The relation between the air flow rates and the corresponding indoor carbon dioxide is analysed and then compared to the existing data from naturally and mechanically ventilated schools. It is found that all three data sets present a CO2 concentration equal to 1000 ppm for air flows around 8 l/p/s. Specific adaptive actions to improve the indoor environmental quality have been recorded and the impact of indoor and ambient temperatures as well as of the carbon dioxide concentration on window opening is analysed in detail. A clear relation is found, between the indoor temperature at which the adapting action takes place and the resulting air flow rate. In parallel, a statistically significant relation between window opening and the indoor-outdoor temperature difference has been established. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A simplified macroscopic method is commonly used for wind-driven ventilation analysis of buildings with small openings. Consequently, it is reasonable to question if and under what conditions will this method provide accurate results in predicting ventilation flow rates in buildings with large openings. We investigate a single-zone cubic building with two equal large openings using a computational fluid dynamics approach. We analyzed the driving forces and the ventilation flow rates due to wind as a function of the geometry, size and relative location of the two openings. The ventilation flow rates are found to be affected by both wind flows around and through the building when the two openings are relatively large. The simplified macroscopic method can provide reasonable engineering accuracy (i.e., less than 10{\%} error) when the porosity of the building envelope does not exceed a critical value. This critical value is not a constant; instead it depends significantly on the degree of alignment between the wind direction and the character of the dominant stream tube associated with the flow through the room. We found that the simplified macroscopic method fails to provide acceptable accuracy when this stream tube is truly dominant and parallel to the wind direction. The effects of wall thickness and aspect ratio of openings are also investigated. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is increasingly being used as a tool for the analysis of outdoor and indoor air flow and thermal conditions. With over half of the world's population living in cities, rapid population growth and dense urban development has increasingly led to the phenomenon of urban heat islands, which in turn contribute to the deteriorating air quality and thermal discomfort in outdoor urban public spaces. In hot arid countries, changes in the characteristics of the urban microclimate are observed due to dense urbanization, high-rise buildings, and industrialization of the building processes and materials, leading to a reduction in thermal comfort in outdoor and indoor spaces. This research highlights the potential of adopting Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as a simulation technique to investigate the complex fluid flow patterns in urban thermal environments, and investigates methods intended to prolong thermal comfort in public places. It discusses the advantages and limitations of CFD tools and the procedural guidelines for conducting CFD simulation. This paper also gives examples of case studies of CFD assessment for indoor and outdoor urban environments, and the practical use of RANS solver in comparison with LES, DES, and DNS models. Finally the paper highlights a case study of a CFD simulation using a RANS turbulence model of an urban street in the hot arid city of Madinah, Saudi Arabia. {\textcopyright} 2014 The authors.},

The first phase of the project focused on the development of a parametric model to determine the average pressure coefficients on exterior building surfaces shielded by a single windward obstruction model block. A pressure modification coefficient was defined to estimate the shielding effect based on the angular relationship between, the shielding block and the surface for which average pressure is to be computed, and the wind direction. The second phase involved expanding the scope of the prediction model to account for the various arrangement possibilities of the shielding blocks relative to the surfaces under investigation. The predicted pressure modification coefficient may be used to estimate average pressure coefficients taking into account the indoor velocity coefficients, surface porosity, window design, and interior partition types. The prediction model considers the effect of multiple shielding blocks, and the gaps between them on a vertical surface relative to wind direction. Wind tunnel verification of the model showed robust estimation of surface pressures in complex urban configurations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {imilarity criteria for modeling atmospheric flows in air and water are reviewed. It isshown that five nondimensional parameters plus a set of nondimensional boundary conditions must be matched in model and prototype. The neglect of the Rossby number can lead to serious errors in modeling of diffusion in a prototype with a length scale greater than about five kilometers. The Reynolds number, the Peclet number and the Reynolds-Schmidt product criteria may be neglected if the model flow is of sufficiently high Reynolds number. The Froude number criterion appears to be the most important. The complete specification of boundary conditions is found to be nebulous, but is discussed in some detail. Over-roughening of the model surface may be necessary to satisfy a roughness Reynolds number criterion. Both air and water appear to be suitable fluids to use as modeling media.},

abstract = {Unlike commercial buildings, many school buildings in China are designed for natural or mechanical ventilation to fulfill thermal comfort without HVAC systems. In hot weather, due to too many students having classes at same time, the thermal conditions in classrooms were so poor to affect student's learning, especially for large lecture rooms. Therefore, it is important to study the ventilation conditions of school buildings and to explore effective means to improve the ventilation design of school buildings. This study was conducted using Fluent CFD software to improve the ventilation performance in one classroom. The field study was carried to collect the actual data of boundary conditions for CFD simulation. In this study, four different ventilation systems were simulated, compared and analyzed. Based on the simulation data, it is found that double rows windows can help to improve the thermal comfort conditions most efficiently, and so do exhaust fans and ceiling fans. But ceiling fans can improve the environment of occupied zones better.},

abstract = {The present work aimed to evaluate the effect of the ventilation on indoor air quality in Italian classrooms. To this end, schools located in the Central Italy were considered in the survey. The results of two experimental analyses are presented: a) data on classrooms' permeability and resultant air exchange rate, b) trends of indoor air quality parameters during heating and non-heating seasons to assess the possible effect of the manual airing technique. Pressurization tests were performed in 16 classrooms to evaluate their air infiltration due to envelope's leakages. The indoor air quality was investigated in 6 classrooms through CO2, particle number concentration and radon concentration measurements which were also related to the manual airing performed by window opening. Results of the pressurization tests revealed that, even in classrooms characterized by a poor maintenance state, the permeability of the envelopes was too low to guarantee acceptable air exchange rates. The analysis of the classrooms' air quality showed that during the fall and winter seasons the airing was ineffective, while it positively affected the indoor air quality during the spring season when strong reductions in CO2 and radon concentrations were recorded. The effect of the manual airing on the infiltration of outdoor generated pollutants was also assessed. As an example, a greater airing effect resulted in a higher penetration of sub-micrometric particles from outdoor: in fact, particle penetration factors of 0.83 and 1 were measured in fall/winter and spring seasons, respectively.},

Of interest to this research is the evaluation of air movement within this building due to spatial composition, which can also prove very useful in helping architects determine how best to renovate and restore historical buildings. The objective is to analyze how radiant heating and passive cooling are currently exploited in the Viipuri Library. The knowledge will be useful to restore this historical building to function efficiently while ensuring that the existing mechanical ventilation systems and natural convective flows work well together after restoration. Computational fluid dynamics will be used to model, simulate and predict multiple environmental conditions to examine spatial layout effects on the ability of natural ventilation to maintain a comfortable thermal environment and acceptable rates of ventilation. The preliminary results demonstrate that airflow and thermal effects can be predicted and validated for any set of conditions, such as specifying which windows or doors are open, and the ambient conditions exterior (e. g., wind and air temperature) and interior (e. g., radiant pipes) to the building.},

abstract = {Wind turbines are the predominate technology for non-hydro renewable energy. As turbines extract energy from wind, a wake or disturbed, turbulent region of wind is created downstreamof the turbine. Wind turbines located in the wake of another turbine do not produce as much power as the upstream turbine. Current modeling efforts fail to accurately predict power losses in downstream turbines by not completely capturing wake effects. Further research to understand and model wake effects is necessary to reduce wake power losses and improve overall wind farm power production. A model is created that simulates the neutrally stratified atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The neutral ABL simulation is validated against three criteria from experimental data. The model is run in both Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Reynolds Averaged Navier- Stokes (RANS) to compare the two methods. Wind turbines at various downstream positions aremodeled within the neutral ABL simulation using an actuator disc. Results from this model include the power deficit ratio of a turbine located in a wake. Power deficit ratios for LES and RANS simulations are within 2-4{\%}and 15-43{\%}of experimental data, respectively. With the results from these simulations, wind farm developers can create a lower-order model to include hundreds of turbines necessary to model an entire wind farm and improve efficiency},

@article{Sukri2009,
abstract = {This paper describes a systematic method of refining a computational grid for the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of flow about a square cylinder. The grid refinement method involves two stages. The first stage constructs computational meshes based on reasonable estimates of cell size and grid stretching ratios and investigates the sensitivity of the computed flow field to these parameters. The findings from this stage are used as a guide for further grid refinement. In the second stage, the grid is divided into four regions to minimise the grid stretching ratio. The smallest cell is sized so the boundary layer on the front face of the cylinder is adequately resolved. Solutions on seven different grids are presented to investigate the effect of numerical scheme, boundary conditions and grid independence. The level of grid independence is evaluated using a form of Richardson extrapolation and the study shows that the finest grid solution has a Grid Convergence Index (GCI) of less than 5{\%}. INTRODUCTION The study of flow around a square cylinder has been and continues to be the subject of intense research (Sohankar et al.; 1998, Saha et al.;2002, Ozgoren;2005, Inoue et al.; 2006 and Doolan;2009). Owing to its simplicity, this shape has become important for the study of the fundamental properties of bluff body wakes. These types of wakes are almost ubiquitous in all fields of engineering. For example, many types of flow mixers rely on bluff body wakes to enhance mixing. Within the scope of predicting the flow field around a square cylinder using numerical analysis, many similar investigations have been made, but the results always show small discrepancies even though the overall global trends are similar. One of the reasons for these discrepancies is the difference in the construction of the mesh. Sohankar et al. (1998) for example, constructed a non-uniform mesh near the wall of a square cylinder and, at 5 diameters away from the cylinder surface, a uniform mesh was applied. The size of the smallest cell was located at the leading edge of the square cylinder with cell size of h/D = 0.004. Another similar study was carried out by Inoue et al. (2006). They constructed a non-uniform mesh but divided the computational domain into three regions, each with a different grid ratio. The smallest cell was located along the edges of the square cylinder with the value of h/D = 0.01. The most recent study by Doolan (2009) investigated the grid convergence for three different grid resolutions on DNS around a square cylinder and found that the solution converged when the smallest cell size along the square cylinder edge was h/D = 0.0167. The DNS results from the three examples show similar physical flow features, such as vortex shedding, but there are small discrepancies in the integrated variables e.g., Strouhal number (St), root mean square lift coefficient (CL rms) and mean drag coefficient (CD mean). It is well accepted by the CFD community that the error from the numerical simulation is not solely from the grid convergence error, but also from many other error sources. However, one can minimise the total error by reducing the error due to grid dependence and this must be done in a systematic manner. The purpose of this study is to assess the DNS grid convergence of flow around a square cylinder. While the results of grid refinement studies are generally reported, there is a need for a detailed assessment to be published to assist those involved in numerical simulation. Further, for the particular case of the square cylinder, there needs to be an objective method of determining adequate resolution of the boundary layers on the upstream face. This paper satisfies both these needs. Two stages of grid refinement are involved in this study and the level of grid convergence for the later stage is evaluated using the Grid Convergence Index (GCI). A novel of assessing grid independence using Thwaites' method is also presented. DNS results from the grid with the lowest GCI are then compared with previously published data. This report is organized as follows. After explaining the test case and the solution methodology, the first grid refinement study is presented and suggestions for grid improvements are made. A second grid refinement study is then described and the level of grid convergence is evaluated. Finally, conclusions are given in the last section.},

With regard to improving surface cover, the appropriate heat island measure techniques on surface cover, i.e., cool roofs, green roofs, and cool pavements, etc., should be preferentially introduced in places where the surface temperatures tend to rise. The effects of urban heat island measure techniques on surface cover are evaluated by surface heat budget on each surface and by solar radiation shielding effects by street trees. With regard to reducing exhaust heat, measures for reducing exhaust heat released from the outdoor units of air condi-tioners are the reduction of cooling loads in rooms and improving heat release methods. Various energy saving strategies have been proposed. Improving the release method of anthropogenic heat so as not to contribute to rises in the air temperature is one of the heat island measures. With regard to improving ventila-tion, preventing heat from staying in the street canyons by improving ventilation near the ground surface is one of the heat island measures. Suppressing the building coverage ratio leads to improvements in ventilation in street canyons. Ventilation in street canyons is improved on wider roads parallel to the main wind direction.},

The topics include indoor natural ventilation, pedestrian wind environment, pollutant dispersion, urban heat island phenomena, urban ventilation, indoor/outdoor thermal comfort, and experimental/numerical techniques to analyze those issues. Winds have a great influence on the outdoor environment, especially in urban areas. Problems that they cause can be attributed to either strong wind or weak wind issues. Strong winds around high-rise buildings can bring about unpleasant, and in some cases dangerous, situations for people in the outdoor environment. On the other hand, weak wind conditions can also cause problems such as air pollution and heat island phenomena in urban areas. Winds enhance urban ventilation and reduce those problems. They also enhance natural ventilation in buildings, which can reduce the energy consumption of mechanical ventilation fans and air conditioners for cooling. Moderate winds improve human thermal comfort in both indoor and outdoor environments in summer. Environmental wind engineering associated with wind tunnel experiments and numerical analysis can contribute to solutions to these issues.},

How to properly deal with this typical configuration for a multi-zone model and integrated simulation is discussed and compared in this paper. In order to validate a newly developed multi-zone model program, MMPN, this paper investigated both buoyancy ventilation and wind-buoyancy combined ventilation.

abstract = {Primary schools in Chinese cities are predominantly located in high-density urban environments with the majority of these schools lacking air conditioning systems. They are extremely dependent on buoyancy-driven natural ventilation because of their location in dense neighborhoods, where local wind velocity is low. This dependency is especially relevant in summer and season transitions, when the temperature difference is small and the relative wind velocity is close to zero. The current authors conducted 168 h of experiments that measured airflow rates in a primary school located in a high-density neighborhood in Beijing. Results from the experiments were used to verify existing correlations that predict airflow rates using meteorological parameters. Three out of the four existing correlations presented a satisfactory prediction when $\Delta$T = 1  C. However, when $\Delta$T {\textless} 1  C, no correlation presented a usable prediction. Therefore, this paper proposes a new hypothetical correlation to predict airflow rates that can accommodate ranges for all temperature differences.},

abstract = {Vattenfall is pursuing a massive expansion of wind power capacity in the following years. The most suitable emplacements for such purpose are already taken so sites which are not so favorable but still economically feasible are to be considered. In order to assess the viability of the complex terrain locations onsite measurements are taken as well as a CFD tools employment is convenient since saves time and cost relative to a complete field measurement program. The current commercial codes are considered somewhat over-priced and not sufficiently flexible when it comes to user-defined models, consequently, it is decided to develop the open source OpenFoam CFD tool. The present thesis project is inside a larger project with which Vattenfall expects to integrate by 2011 OpenFoam CFD tool and be able to make wind power production accurate predictions over complex terrain. OpenFoam CFD tool was validated using two different cases: a flat plane and an axisymmetric plane getting results which strongly resembled to Fluent commercial code results. New wall functions including roughness were added to OpenFoams current version (OF-1.5.) in order to be able to establish non-uniform variable roughness along the domain. In addition, a pre-processing tool was developed (roughnessToFoam) which permits an easy addition of the roughness data arising from map format file. The implemented wall functions were validated and turned out to work even better than the commercial code Fluent. Coriolis and gravitational forces were successfully implemented being validated with theoretical formulation. It was appreciated that coriolis force can have a considerable influence when we come to domains which can span up to 20 km at high latitude places, therefore, it is considered that is necessary to take it into account. Eventually, Openfoams pre-processing tool SnappyHexMesh was evaluated in order to analyze whether is useful or not to mesh complex terrains. Two cases were tried to be meshed and whereas the first one (bump case) was correctly meshed, when trying to mesh the second (Askervein hill) problems arose if many surface layers were wanted to be added. It was concluded that more research is needed in order to get the most of the meshing tool, since the big amount of variable needed to be set make it quite difficult to control correctly the process.},

abstract = {Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), energy efficiency through passive building design strategies and sustainable construction practices have been highly prioritized in recent years. This paper presents a Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel study on wind-driven natural ventilation for a low-rise building at a model-testing scale of 1:20. The experiment consists of testing various size openings in a single wall, opposite side walls and adjacent side walls with and without portioning walls, with and without opening cover screens, with and without internal volume correction for 36 different wind angles of attacks (unless symmetrical). For the size of the building and openings considered, the experimental analyses indicated that internal volume correction using velocity scaling was important, although this criterion could be relaxed for cross-ventilation with openings in opposite walls. The internal pressure due to cross-ventilation was 1.5-2.5 times higher for Ainlet/Aoutlet {\textgreater} 1 compared with ratios Ainlet/Aoutlet {\textless} 1. In general, the lower the opening ratio (or inlet to outlet ratio), the higher the pressure drop inside the building. For an equivalent opening ratio, openings on opposite-walls generated a higher pressure drop compared to openings on adjacent-walls. Room-partitioning significantly affected the distribution of internal pressures, and hence the pressure drop that favored the ventilation in each room for the considered partitioning case. In addition, the total discharge coefficient Cd{\_}total and the ventilation rate Q/(VrA) increased with an increase of the opening ratio. The inlet discharge coefficients obtained in this experiment ranged from 0.65 to 1.08, similar to the results of various early studies. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop an adaptive thermal comfort equation for naturally ventilated buildings in hot-humid climates. The study employed statistical meta-analysis of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) RP-884 database, which covered several climatic zones. The data were carefully sorted into three climate groups including hot-humid, hot-dry, and moderate and were analyzed separately. The results revealed that the adaptive equations for hot-humid and hot-dry climates were analogous with approximate regression coefficients of 0.6, which were nearly twice those of ASHRAE and European standards 55 and EN15251, respectively. The equation using the daily mean outdoor air temperature had the highest coefficient of determination for hot-humid climate, compared with other mean temperatures that considered acclimatization of previous days. Acceptable comfort ranges showed asymmetry and leaned toward operative temperatures below thermal neutrality for all climates. In the hot-humid climate, a lower comfort limit was not observed for naturally ventilated buildings, and the adaptive equation was influenced by indoor air speed rather than indoor relative humidity. The new equation developed in this study can be applied to tropical climates and hot-humid summer seasons of temperate climates.},

@article{Toge2012,
abstract = {The main objective is to develop a simulation model in OpenFOAM which can be used to study the transition from pressure to gravity driven flow in vertical pipelines. A pump is connected upstream, ensuring pressure driven flow while running. As the pump shuts down and water is drained a transition is expected to occur from pressure driven to gravity driven flow. A release valve is attached at the top of the vertical pipeline. It ensures air is induced as the pressure inside the pipeline decreases below the atmospheric pressure. The standard NORSOK P-001 (2006) recommends that vertical gravity lines shall be sized in accordance to a Froude number less than 0.3. An increased Froude number is expected to cause air entrainment and pulsations. In accordance to Osenbroch (2011) the origin of the design criteria is unknown, and to some extend it appears that a higher Froude number of 0.6-0.7 is used. A literature study shall therefore be performed with respect to relevant theory. In OpenFOAM a two phase model named interFoam is adopted to study five vertical pipes of 20m height. Four cases are vented while the last is unvented. Three of the cases are associated with a 4" vent, while the main pipe diameter is set to respectively 12", 18" and 24". These changes are expected to indicate how the main pipe diameter affects the flow pattern. The fourth case is an 18" pipeline subjected to a 2" vent. An identical main pipe diameter is simulated without a vent. Three different vent designs of respective 4", 2" and unvented is therefore examined for an identical main pipe diameter of 18". Changes in vent design are expected to affect the flow pattern. The literature review examines the definition of the Froude number and its relationship to physical problems. A relevant topic regarding transient theory is incorporated. Generally it describes how flow is affected by a valve closure. The origin of the Froude number design criterion is also presented according to previous research. However, it is based on a scarce open literature. Cases subjected to a 4" vent is fully drained during equal time intervals of 2 minutes. However, the total water volume differs due to the main pipe diameter of respectively 12", 18" and 24". Water must therefore drain at an increased flow rate as the main pipe diameter increases. All cases are characterized by a linear pressure decrease subsequent to the pump shut down. The presented transient theory describes this phenomenon. As the pump shuts down, pressure drops close to the pump due to flow retardation. This causes a negative pressure wave to propagate downstream. If pressure is sufficiently decreased vapor bubbles may form, which is also known as flashing. Propagation of a pressure wave is known as water hammer. The Froude number criterion mentioned in the standard NORSOK P-001 (2006) appears to apply for draining from a process vessel. A Froude number less than 0.3 is recommended to ensure the vertical pipe is running full. If the Froude number is increased beyond 0.3, a weir is formed at the top surface and air is sucked into the liquid flow. However, this theory assumes a considerably wide process vessel. Transient theory seems to apply greater knowledge to future design, than does the Froude number. Water hammer may be the phenomenon which causes vibrations during shut down, rather than oscillations due to air entrainment. Water hammer is caused by abruptly changes in fluid flow, and it is the change in velocity which determines the magnitude of the liner pressure decrease. Rapid changes in flow velocity should therefore be avoided. It must be stated that solutions are found on very coarse meshes, which affects the accuracy of the results. Results are however assumed to indicate how the flow regime transforms and how it is affected by boundary conditions. The pump shut down in the simulation is also too rapid. In reality the flow must decrease during a finite time period.},

Reducing energy consumption in buildings is therefore a priority for energy efficiency. The present investigation explores the most adequate roof shapes compatible with the placement of different types of small wind energy generators on high-rise buildings for urban wind energy exploitation. The wind flow around traditional state-of-the-art roof shapes is considered. In addition, the influence of the roof edge on the wind flow on high-rise buildings is analyzed. These geometries are investigated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the turbulence intensity threshold for horizontal axis wind turbines is considered. The most adequate shapes for wind energy exploitation are identified, studying vertical profiles of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence intensity. Curved shapes are the most interesting building roof shapes from the wind energy exploitation point of view, leading to the highest speed-up and the lowest turbulence intensity.},

In this study, detailed wind tunnel experiments were performed on the cross-ventilation flow of a generic single-zone building in order to compile a validation database for CFD methods. Both the velocity fields and the contaminant concentration fields were measured and investigated. First, the fundamental characteristics of the velocity and concentration fields in a cross-ventilated flow were investigated for the building in unsheltered conditions. Next, the distributions of turbulent scalar fluxes in a cross-ventilated flow, which have been rarely reported, were also measured, and the scalar transport mechanism was examined based on the results. Finally, the effect of the surrounding buildings on the cross-ventilation flow was investigated. This study shows that the turbulent velocity fluctuations and concentration fluctuations are clearly generated by different mechanisms. These results can be used to effectively and successfully validate CFD methods applied to the flow and concentration fields of cross-ventilation flows.},

This paper presents a coupled CFD modelling approach for urban wind flow and indoor natural ventilation. A specific procedure is used to efficiently and simultaneously generate the geometry and the high-resolution body-fitted grid for both the outdoor and indoor environment. This procedure allows modelling complex geometries with full control over grid quality and grid resolution, contrary to standard semi-automatic unstructured grid generation procedures. It also provides a way to easily implement various changes in the model geometry and grid for parametric studies. As a case study, a parametric analysis of natural ventilation is performed for the geometrically complex Amsterdam ArenA stadium in the Netherlands. The turbulent wind flow and temperature distribution around and inside the stadium are solved with the 3D steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Special attention is given to CFD solution verification and validation. It is shown that small geometrical modifications can increase the ventilation rate by up to 43{\%}. The coupled modelling approach and grid generation procedure presented in this paper can be used similarly for future studies of wind flow and related processes in complex urban environments. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Natural ventilation is of increasing interest in building industry because of recent focus on environmental concern, considered with both comfort and economical criteria. The aim of this study is to investigate how wind may induce natural ventilation, with focus on wind incidence and large scale environment density influences. These parameters modify flows inside and outside buildings. Numerical dynamic simulations are achieved for a standard office building using pressure coefficients obtained from a parametrical model. Simulations allow to describe inside building air flow for three incidences: 0 , 45 , 90  and three theoretical environments: open, suburban and urban. Originality of this study is to work with both vertical and horizontal pressure coefficient gradients. Results show how important horizontal gradients are in air flow comprehension. Urban wind driven ventilation potential is also discussed. Some words are said on existing tools limitations. The need for further studies is illustrated in order to obtain handy pressure coefficients prediction tools and to optimize openings mechanical regulation.

We previously described a coupled multidomain method to couple analytical models of the downstream domains with 3D numerical models of the upstream vasculature. This prior work either included pure resistance boundary conditions or impedance boundary conditions based on assumed periodicity of the solution. However, flow and pressure in arteries are not necessarily periodic in time due to heart rate variability, respiration, complex transitional flow or acute physiological changes. We present herein an approach for prescribing lumped parameter outflow boundary conditions that accommodate transient phenomena. We have applied this method to compute haemodynamic quantities in different physiologically relevant cardiovascular models, including patient-specific examples, to study non-periodic flow phenomena often observed in normal subjects and in patients with acquired or congenital cardiovascular disease. The relevance of using boundary conditions that accommodate transient phenomena compared with boundary conditions that assume periodicity of the solution is discussed.},

The tested window types were double vertical slide window, turn window, tilt window, awning window, horizontal pivot window and vertical pivot window. Each testing of these types comprised different opening rates, so that the performances could be compared across a wide range of window states. Performance criteria were the mass flow, the air change rate and the CO2 removal rate, each of them normalised to a temperature difference of 1 K. The horizontal pivot window turned out to be the best performing type of window. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Prediction of single-sided natural ventilation is difficult due to the bi-directional flow at the opening and the complex flow around buildings. A new empirical model was developed that can predict the mean ventilation rate and fluctuating ventilation rate due to the pulsating flow and eddy penetration of single-sided, wind-driven natural ventilation in buildings. The governing equation is based on the non-uniform pressure distribution along the opening height. The new model shows that the ventilation rate and wind velocity are linearly correlated. This investigation studied the eddy penetration effect in the frequency domain based on fast Fourier transform. Large eddy simulation (LES) and experimental data were used to validate the new empirical model. The model has also been used to analyze the influence of the opening geometry and elevation on the ventilation rate. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper reveals the failure of a naturally ventilated LEED-certified townhouse development project in China mentioned in recent research. The house owners made great alterations for the purpose of decoration, which removed or minimized the effectiveness of natural ventilation elements in the original design. The research shows that the houses show  International Style' because the natural ventilation design principles were not fully applied in the design and the localized natural ventilation strategies were not fully considered by means of computational simulation in the design stage. Also, the lack of communication between designers and the owners caused the removal of most natural ventilation elements of these houses during the occupancy period. The authors advocate three criteria to avoid failures of natural ventilation design: localized/ climate adaptive design, relationship among design elements and design intention awareness.},

abstract = {As in the first and second editions, the book revolves around the fact that turbulence modeling is one of three key elements in CFD. Very precise mathematical theories have evolved for the other two, viz., grid generation and algorithm development. By its nature, i.e., creating a mathematical model that approximates the physical behavior of turbulent flows, far less precision has been achieved in turbulence modeling. This text addresses the problem of selecting/devising such models. The fundamental premise is, in the spirit of G. I. Taylor, an ideal model should introduce the minimum amount of complexity while capturing the essence of the relevant physics. The text begins with the simplest models and charts a course leading to some of the most complex models that have been applied to a nontrivial flow. Along the way, a systematic methodology is presented for developing and analyzing turbulence models. The methodology makes use of tensor calculus, similarity solutions, singular perturbation methods, and numerical procedures. The text stresses the need to achieve a balance amongst the physics of turbulence, mathematical tools required to solve turbulence-model equations, and common numerical problems attending their use (i.e., what good is a model if it makes your program crash?). Several user friendly programs and detailed user's guides are provided on the Compact Disk that accompanies the text. Many of the applications are used throughout the text to permit comparison of complicated models with simpler models. A completely objective point of view is taken in assessing the merits of models and their range of applicability. The text includes an extensive Bibliography, a detailed Index and well thought out homework problems of varying degrees of difficulty.},

The values of Cp are traditionally derived based on wind tunnel studies. However, since it is not possible to always conduct wind tunnel tests to obtain the Cp values, alternative approaches have been suggested. One approach involves the use of statistical regression analysis of data obtained from wind tunnel studies. In this paper, Cp values of a shophouse building under investigation are generated using wind tunnel, a WPD model, which is based on the regression analysis of wind tunnel data as well as based on wall averaged values from published data. Using the Cp values obtained from the wind tunnel as the reference, the accuracy of the Cp values generated by the WPD model and the wall averaged values are analysed and discussed. The effects of such accuracy on the computed air flow rates and age of air for the building using a multi-zone network airflow model are also considered. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The additional expansion parameter (eta) is the ratio of the turbulent to mean strain time scale. While low-order expansions appear to provide an adequate description of the Reynolds stress, no finite truncation of the expansion for the production of dissipation term in powers of eta suffices - terms of all orders must be retained. Based on these ideas, a new two-equation model and Reynolds stress transport model are developed for turbulent shear flows. The models are tested for homogeneous shear flow and flow over a backward facing step. Comparisons between the model predictions and experimental data are excellent.},

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) offers detailed information about indoor flow patterns, air movement, temperature and local draught distribution in buildings, so it has unique advantages as an efficient and cost-effective tool for optimum design in a complex built environment.$\backslash$nThis thesis shows the use of CFD to simulate the coupled external and internal flow field around a 6m cubic building with two small openings.  To study both wind driven and combined wind and buoyancy driven cross ventilation through a full-scale cubic structure, un-structured grid CFD and a steady envelope flow model were applied to calculate mean ventilation rates.  To validate the CFD results, full-scale experiments were undertaken under various weather conditions in England.  $\backslash$nFor wind driven ventilation RANS model predictions were proved reliable when wind directions were near normal to the ventilation openings, i.e. 0o{\~{}}30o.  However, when the fluctuating ventilation played a more dominant role than the mean flow (90o) RANS models were incapable of predicting the total ventilation rate.  Improved results may be expected by applying more sophisticated turbulence models, such as LES, weighted quasi-steady approximations, or unsteady envelope flow models.  In the thesis experience on the modelling of combined wind and thermal effects is outlined and feedback is provided to CFD code developers to enable further improvements for building ventilation studies.  The full-scale field testing data from this study is valuable for comparison with wind tunnel results and validation of CFD applications.},

The acceptable operative temperature for naturally conditioned space supplied by the ASHARE Standard 55-2004 has been used for the comfort temperature setting. Dynamic simulations for a typical office room in the five representative cities, which are Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Guangzhou, have been carried out. The study demonstrates that the NVCP depends on the multiple impacts of climate, the building's thermal characteristics, internal gains, ventilation profiles and regimes. The work shows how the simplified method can be used to generate detailed, indoor, operative temperature data based on the various building conditions and control profiles which are used to investigate the NVCP at the strategic design stage.

Over the past few decades, a rapid development in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has resulted in the widespread use of this technique not only as an environmental research tool but also as an architectural design tool. However, given real building morphologies and particular architectural requirements for the modeling and data analysis, the frequently used methods in research work are unsuitable for practical application. Therefore, this study focuses on the practical application of CFD to bridge the gap between wind engineering and architectural design. This study aims to provide a framework to accurately predict the pedestrian level wind environment, and identify the wind-related design issues. The methods are provided to answer the questions encountered by wind consultants and architects, particularly those on the input boundary condition, simulation modeling, modeling verification, data collection and analysis.

abstract = {Building occupants are a rich source of information about indoor environmental quality and its effect on comfort and productivity. The Center for the Built Environment has developed a Web-based survey and accompanying online reporting tools to quickly and inexpensively gather, process and present this information. The core questions assess occupant satisfaction with the following IEQ areas: office layout, office furnishings, thermal comfort, indoor air quality, lighting, acoustics, and building cleanliness and maintenance. The survey can be used to assess the performance of a building, identify areas needing improvement, and provide useful feedback to designers and operators about specific aspects of building design features and operating strategies. The survey has been extensively tested and refined and has been conducted in more than 70 buildings, creating a rapidly growing database of standardized survey data that is used for benchmarking. We present three case studies that demonstrate different applications of the survey: a pre/post analysis of occupants moving to a new building, a survey used in conjunction with physical measurements to determine how environmental factors affect occupants' perceived comfort and productivity levels, and a benchmarking example of using the survey to establish how new buildings are meeting a client's design objectives. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: In addition to its use in benchmarking a building's performance against other buildings, the CBE survey can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify specific problems and their sources. Whenever a respondent indicates dissatisfaction with an aspect of building performance, a branching page follows with more detailed questions about the nature of the problem. This systematically collected information provides a good resource for solving indoor environmental problems in the building. By repeating the survey after a problem has been corrected it is also possible to assess the effectiveness of the solution.},

abstract = {Airflow utilization is a traditional and effective way for people to improve their thermal comfort in summer in the areas of China that are hot and humid. We conducted a summer-long field study on nine naturally ventilated buildings in Guangzhou and collected airflow-related behaviors, motivations, and perceptions from 32 college students. The results show that the behaviors of opening windows and doors were driven by both indoor air quality and thermal comfort motivations. The proportions of open windows and doors increased linearly and slowly with the indoor ET*, and the acceptable range for opening windows and doors was an indoor ET* ???30.3??C with the condition that a maximum of 0.25m/s indoor air speed needs to be achieved. The behaviors of using fans were driven by thermal comfort motivations. The proportions of use of fans increased strongly with the indoor ET*, and the acceptable range for using fans was an indoor ET* ???31.0??C with the condition that a maximum of 0.87m/s indoor air speed needs to be achieved. A strategy for airflow utilization was proposed. Our study is believed to provide a better understanding of airflow-related behaviors, motivations, and perceptions as well as better designs of natural ventilation and fans and better simulations of performance for buildings in the hot and humid areas of China.},

@article{Zhang2007,
abstract = {Air distribution in enclosed environments is crucial to thermal comfort and air quality. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has played an important role in evaluating and designing various air distribution. Many factors can influence the applications of CFD for studying air distribution. The most critical factors are the selection of an appropriate CFD approach and a turbulence model. Recent advances in CFD approaches and turbulence models provide great potential for improving prediction accuracy of air distribution in enclosed environments. This paper summarizes recent progress in CFD turbulence modeling and its application to some practical indoor environment studies. Also described are turbulence models that either are commonly used or have been proposed and used recently for indoor environment modeling. Finally, this study further identifies a few turbulence models that show great potential for modeling airflows in enclosed environments. A companion paper presents the evaluation of the selected models by using experimental data from the literature.},

abstract = {Results are presented from a series of numerical studies designed to investigate the atmospheric boundary layer structure, ambient wind, and pollutant source location and their impacts on the wind field and pollutant distribution within the built-up areas of Shenyang, China. Two models, namely, Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) software package and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, are used in the present study. Then the high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical experiments were performed under the typical simulated atmospheric boundary conditions. It was found that the atmospheric boundary structure played a crucial role in the pollution within the building cluster, which determined the potential turbulent diffusion ability of the atmospheric surface layer; the change of the ambient wind direction can significantly affect the dispersion pattern of pollutants, which was a more sensitive factor than the ambient wind speed; under a given atmospheric state, the location of the pollution sources would dramatically determine the pollution patterns within built-up areas. The WRF-CFD numerical evaluation is a reliable method to understand the complicated flow and dispersion within built-up areas.},

abstract = {The relative freshness of indoor air in breathing zone can be measured by ventilation effectiveness. Numerous research articles in literature have investigated ventilation effectiveness under different ventilation schemes, different inlet/outlet positions, and different diffusor types. These researches seem to have a goal to find a solution to optimize ventilation effectiveness through manipulating ventilation system. In reality, however, the occupants of a rented office room have no right to manipulate the ventilation system; instead, they have to accept whatever rented to them. An important issue thus arises: how to improve ventilation effectiveness without changing ventilation system? This paper has built a CFD model about a typical office room, validated it by published experimental data in literature, and then applied it to twelve typical office situations/cases of different furniture layouts under different ventilation schemes. The simulation results of twelve cases show that furniture layout is an important factor in indoor airflow and temperature fields, and the quality of air in breathing zone can be significantly improved by adjusting furniture layout without making any change in ventilation system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
