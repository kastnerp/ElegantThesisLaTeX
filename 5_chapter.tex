%, which is the process of determining that the implementation of a model represents the developer's concept of the model and solution.
Thus, we use validation methods which assess to which quantifiable extent a model is able to represent reality \citep{AIAA1998}. 
%Due to time limitations and preexisting best practice guidelines for environmental flows \citep{Franke2004,Franke2006,Franke2007,Franke2010,Blocken,Ramponi2012} this chapter will focus on validation of the results, such as comparing the results with experimental data in order to quantify accuracy and errors. 
In the validation study, the following elements will be examined \citep{Slater2008,Franke2007}:

\begin{itemize}
%	\item Comparison against experimental datak
	\item Implementation of the model
	\item Consistency
	\item Mesh refinement  
	\item Iterative convergence
	\item Spatial convergence	
	\item Sensitivity of boundary conditions	
\end{itemize}

Finally, the \textit{potentialFoam} solver should be implemented in the work-flow, which could not be done in this thesis in the interest of time.
The \textit{potentialFoam} solver provides initial fields by only solving the pressure equation of the \gls{NSE}.
Thus, it can be used as an efficient solver, initializing the velocity field for more complex solvers like \textit{simpleFoam}. 
As a result, instead of starting from a resting flow with \textit{simpleFoam}, the \textit{potentialFoam} solution may be used as an initial guess and to help to achieve convergence faster.

\subsubsection{Spatial convergence}
\label{sec:validation:spatial_convergence}
\index{validation!spatial convergence}

In this section, the 4 stages of mesh refinement discussed in \fref{sec:validation:mesh_fineness} are used to determine whether spatial convergence is obtained.
In doing so, one is able to determine up to which extent the mesh should be refined to ensure that  the result for a derived variable (such as the flow rate) will not change significantly with further iterations.

Along with this, another method that falls under the spatial convergence assessment method is called \gls{RE} \citep{Slater2008}. 
It predicts the variable of interest for a theoretically perfect grid with zero grid spacing\textemdash essentially a continuum\textemdash by using lower-order discrete values of that same variable.

Moreover, one is able to estimate the numerical discretization error caused by various mesh sizes. 
This allows to estimate the error due to discretization altogether. 
\Fref{tab:grid_convergence_study} shows the parameters of the 4 mesh sizes studied.

The effective grid refinement ratio $r$ for unstructured grids is defined as:

\begin{equation}
r = \left( \frac{N_{i}}{N_{i+1}}\right)^\frac{1}{D}
