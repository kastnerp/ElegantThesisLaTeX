How to change the citation style
--------------------------------

Switch can be made in the file `header.tex`.

1. For a numbered bibliography, look for the two switches `Numbered Bibliography` and `APA Style` and uncomment the entire code block depending on which one you prefer.

2. Recompile

*Note: With APA, you cannot use the `\citep{}` command, hence you will have to change all `\citep{}` into `\cite{}`*
